            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61358:6"/>
diſcontinuance of it, and demanded Iudgment if the Plaintiff ſhould have a new <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diminution,</hi> upon which the Plaintiff did demurr: <hi>Coke,</hi> this ſecond <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> is not maintainable: For the firſt Writ ſent to the Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> could not be ſued out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> for it is not a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi> but a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diminution:</hi> For in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter there are but two <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi> the firſt to remove Record, the ſecond <hi>Quod coram vobis reſidet,</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 19. and in the Writ there is not any mention of <hi>Error,</hi> and therefore it cannot be a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and if there be not any ſuch <hi>Writ</hi> in the Regiſter, then it is a good argument to ſay there is no <hi>Writ</hi> at all, as the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> argued in the Lady <hi>Hale</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 262. in <hi>Plowden</hi> in the Caſe of the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Eſcheat:</hi> Alſo it is againſt all the precedents, that a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error, Quod coram vobis reſidet,</hi> ſhould be otherwiſe entred than upon the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and not upon a new Record, and the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diminution</hi> is not an <hi>Original Writ,</hi> and ought always iſſue out of the Court where the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> is depending: And alſo the party cannot now alledge <hi>Diminution, i.</hi> after a <hi>Scire facias ad audiendum Errores,</hi> which ſee 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Diminution.</note>45. by <hi>Huſſey:</hi> For by the <hi>Scire facias ad audiendum Errores,</hi> he affirms the Record to be full: So 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 25. After the Defendant in the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> hath pleaded <hi>in nullo eſt erratum</hi> he ſhall not alledge <hi>Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for the parties are agreed upon the Record, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 10. after a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> the Plaintiff ſhall never aſſign <hi>Errors</hi> in fact, <hi>&amp;c. Tanfield</hi> contrary, he agreed, that a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diminution</hi> cannot be ſued out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> but that will not hurt us, for it is idle and utterly void: And when the Record is removed, it is not material how it comes in, ſo as it be here, for they are both the King's Court, as it is in the common Caſe of Indictments: and then the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Record, <hi>Quod coram vobis reſidet,</hi> And although the ſame be in divers Rolls, the ſame is no matter of Exception;<note place="margin">Entry of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</note> but if the Roll be entred in a wrong Office it is not good, but if all be in one Office, the misfiling of the Roll will be no hurt: So here, it is not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal as it ought; yet it is not any prejudice to us. But the great matter is, if the Plaintiff may aſſign new <hi>Errors</hi> and have a new <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diminution,</hi> two of the <hi>Errors</hi> aſſigned in the Meſne Proces, but the third is in the Record it ſelf; <hi>i.</hi> the Iudgment. And there is no doubt but that a man may have divers <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi> but he ſhall have but one <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> and ſo divers <hi>Errors,</hi> but one delay: Alſo it is not a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diminution</hi> which we have ſued, for I do not ſay that it is a thing below, which is not here, but I ſay that is not a thing below which ought to be, <hi>viz.</hi> there is not any diſcontinuance; but the Court awarded that <hi>Writ</hi> for their ſatisfaction, for the <hi>non eſſe</hi> of the thing ſhall come on the other ſide, and 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. the Court awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a <hi>Certiorare</hi> to enform themſelves.

A man avows for a Rent due at ſuch a day, and is nonſuit; Now he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow for the ſame Rent, and ſuppoſe the ſame to be due at another day,<note place="margin">Eſtoppell.</note> for he ſhall not be eſtopped by the Record upon which he was non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit: and ſo here upon the whole matter the <hi>Writ</hi> out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> is not material, and the Roll is not miſplaced, but is in the right Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: Alſo this is not a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diminution,</hi> but a <hi>Writ</hi> to inform the Iuſtices, Wherefore upon the whole matter the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> will well lie.

Paſc.</hi> at which day <hi>Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre</hi> appeared, and caſt an Eſſoyn; and notwithſtanding that, a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs was awarded againſt them both, retornable <hi>Craſtin. Trinit.</hi> and this awarding of the Diſtreſs was erroneous, for the Eſſoyn was, as appeareth, to ſave, &amp;c. and therefore againſt him no Diſtreſs ought to have been awarded: And upon alledging of Diminution the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Eſſoyn was certified, but the ſame doth not appear upon the Plea Roll. 2. This Record is, <hi>ideo ipſi in miſericordia,</hi> and ſo both the Defendants are amerced for their default of appearance 15 <hi>Paſch.</hi> whereas <hi>Savacre</hi> was then Eſſoyned, and ſo no cauſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coke,</hi> The Original <hi>Writ</hi> was ſued <hi>Mich.</hi> 26 <hi>Eliz.</hi> retorned 15 <hi>Hillarii,</hi> and then both the Defendants made default, for which an Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was awarded, retornable 15 <hi>Paſc.</hi> and then <hi>Savacre</hi> appeared, and Iudgment given, <hi>quod ipſi ſint in miſericordia,</hi> in which point the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> is apparent: but I conceive that it is not <hi>Error,</hi> for upon the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment the parties ought to put in Sureties for their appearance; and the ſaid Sureties took upon them, that the Defendants and each of them ſhould appear; and if they or any of them make default, they ſhall be amerced: And ſo here, this Iudgment, <hi>ideo ipſi in miſericodia,</hi> doth refer to the Sureties, not to the parties, for the Defendants ſhall not be amerced until the end of the Suit, and but once onely in an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which ſee <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Entries</hi> 464 where there was but one Defendant: and therefore if the amercements ſhall be referred to the Defendant, then it ſhall be <hi>ideo ipſe,</hi> not <hi>ipſi, &amp;c.</hi> And that is the Reaſon wherefore the <hi>Queen,</hi> nor an Infant, ſhall not find Pledges, for no amercement ſhall be upon their default, therefore it were in vain for them to find Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp;c. If the Sureties be amerced where they ought not to be amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Law, yet the Defendant ſhall not have a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, for he is not the party grieved by the amercement: and upon that Reaſon it is, if in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Bail erroneous Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given, the Defendant in the Action ſhall not have a <hi>Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> The awarding of the Diſtreſs upon the Roll againſt both, where one of them only made default, is not Error, eſpecially as this caſe is: for although one of them was eſſoyned until the day aforeſaid, yet at that day they make default, and ſo the Diſtreſs well awarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: and although the <hi>Writ</hi> was not well awarded, yet when they appear <hi>Craſtin. Trinit.</hi> at the day of the Retorn of the Diſtreſs, all meſn defaults in the Proceſs are ſaved, and ſo the miſawarding of the Diſtreſs by appearance after is ſupplyed: as 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 7. The Law requires, that in an Action founded upon the Statute of <hi>Praemunire, &amp;c.</hi> 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Defendant gave Garniſhment by two Months, yet if the Defendant, not having warning appear, now the Proceſs is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: So 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 18. where upon any Proceſs the Defendant doth appear, although the day of appearance be not lawful, yet he ſhall be put to anſwer, and ſee many Caſes there to that purpoſe.

                     <hi>Manwood.</hi> All the doubt of this caſe is, If the ſaid term was in <hi>Tho. Cranmer</hi> ſo as he might forfeit it? And he conceived, that the ſaid term was in <hi>Tho.

Such a Grant is good and effectual, and if he do not grant it his Executors ſhall have it, and yet the term was not limited to him, but he ſhall have it by implication of Law. 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. A Leaſe was made to one, his Heirs and Aſſigns during his life, and one year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Executors ſhall have the ſaid term after the death of the Leſſee, yet the ſaid term was not limited to him: 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. A Leaſe made for term of live and a year after, in that caſe the term is conjoyned unto the Eſtate for life by the act of the Grantor himſelf; and there is a difference when the Remainder is joyned to the particular Eſtate by the act of the Grantor, and by any Purchaſe, Grant, or any act af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for in the firſt caſe the Remainder ſhall be executed, but in the latter not. A Leaſe for life, the Remainder in tail, the Remainder to the right Heirs of Tenant for life; he in the Remainder in tail dyeth without iſſue in the life of Tenant for life, now the Fee is executed to the Freehold, &amp;c. and the Heir ſhall not have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> where ſuch conveyance is made by Fine. See 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 29. In a <hi>Cui in vita, A.</hi> Executor of <hi>B.</hi> came and ſaid, that the Land in demand was Leaſed to the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> for the term of his life, the Remainder for the term of eight years to his Executors, and prayed to be received, and they were received.

A Leaſe was made for life to <hi>A.</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to his Executors for twelve years: the Leſſe for life died, the Executors died, there it is agreed, that the Executors of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors ſhould have an Action of Covenant, if they be ouſted.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Harper,</hi> Iuſtice, contrary: Many caſes put before may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for in the ſaid caſe the term is limited to begin immediately, and not by way of Remainder, or after the death of the Leſſee, and then the Executors in the life of the Teſtator are not known, nor able to ſeek any thing by the name of Executors, and therefore that term ſhall take its beginning in the life of the Teſtator: But in the Caſe at Bar the term is limited to the Executors after the death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator,<note place="margin">Co. 1 Inſt. 54. b.</note> and the Executor takes the term as a Purchaſor, and he hath it not as a Chattel of the Teſtator, but as his own Chattel. And in the Caſe of Receipt before cited, the Executor ſhall be received as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, for the term was limited to him as Executor. And here the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">1 Cro. 666.</note> is to be conſidered, for it extends as well to Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels as to Freehold, and the Statute doth execute the poſſeſſion to the uſe limited for years, as for life, or in Fee: and here the uſe is limited to the Executors, and not to the Teſtator, and therefore it ſhall not be otherwiſe transferred. And therefore if a man ſeiſed in the Right of his Wife diſcontinueth, and afterwards the Diſcontinuee makes a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61358:8"/>
Feoffment in Fee unto the uſe of the ſaid Husband and Wife for their lives, in that caſe the Wife ſhall not be remitted; for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute doth transfer according to the uſe, and the uſe was limited for their lives, therefore they ſhall not be in of another Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dyer,</hi> chief Iuſtice, to the ſame intent: The Feoffor, <hi>i. Thomas Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> limits all the uſes, and therefore he ſhall not have that which he hath limited; and it is in the nature of a Reſervation, which ſhall be taken ſtrictly and very ſtrong againſt him who made the Reſervation: and he relied much upon the laſt Reaſon urged by <hi>Harper</hi> upon the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that this was limited to the Executors,<note place="margin">Co. 13. Rep.</note> and not to him who limited it, and therefore the poſſeſſion ſhall be executed to the Executors, to whom the uſe was limited; and this term ſhall not be Aſſets in the hands of the Executors: And he ſaid, That he had ſeen a Record, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſetting forth, That <hi>A.</hi> having Feoffees to his uſe, deviſed, that his Feoffees ſhould ſell his Lands, who did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; now the money coming by the ſale ſhall be Aſſets, &amp;c. but it is not ſo limited in our caſe, therefore it ſhall not be Aſſets. A Leaſe is made to <hi>A.</hi> for life, the Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>B. B.</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth the Eſtate of <hi>A.</hi> the Eſtate in Remainder is not executed, for it is not conveyed by the Grant of the firſt Grantor, but by the Act of another perſon after the Grant. A Leaſe for life to <hi>A.</hi> the Remainder to a Feme ſole for years, they entermarry, Waſte is committed, the Leſſor brings an Action of Waſte, he ſhall recover as well the Eſtate for years as for life. <hi>A.</hi> Leaſeth unto <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder unto the Executors of <hi>A.</hi> for years, the Remainder over in Fee to a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Remainder for years is good, for the Leſſor cannot limit ſuch an Eſtate to himſelf, and the Executors ſhall take the Eſtate as Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſors, and the term ſhall be in abeyance untill the death of <hi>A.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a caſe before the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Mary, viz.</hi> A Leaſe was made for life, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if the Leſſee dieth within the term of ſixty years, that the Executors ſhall have the Lands, as in the Right and Title of the Leſſee, <hi>pro termino totidem annorum,</hi> which do amount to the number of ſixty years, to be accounted from the ſaid Indenture. The Opinion of the Iuſtices of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> upon the Caſe was, That the term was not in the Leſſee for life. So this future term in the principal Caſe was not in <hi>Tho. Cranmer.</hi> But ſee that Caſe cited by <hi>Dyer,</hi> reported by himſelf 4 <hi>Ma.</hi> 150. and there the opinion of the Court was, That the ſame was not a Leaſe, but a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And afterwards in the principal Caſe Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, That the future term was not forfeited by the Attainder of <hi>Cranmer.</hi>

for one of the Horſes onely, and not for all the Horſes contained in the Gift, for no more than one Horſe was fraudulently given: And as by the firſt branch the Gift is void but for one Horſe, ſo by the ſecond branch the penalty extends but unto one Horſe, for the fraud extends but to one Horſe, and no farther.

A uſe is nothing elſe but a truſt and confidence, and was not any Inheritance by the courſe of the Common Law; for no mention is made of uſes in our ancient Books, when the Common Law greatly flouriſhed, as in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 1. and <hi>E.</hi> 3. and alſo uſes are not ſubject to the grounds of Law: And although divers Statutes have been made for the avoiding of divers policies for the gaining of Lands in <hi>Mortmain,</hi> yet the makers of the ſaid Statutes could not find out any ſuch convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to uſes. See the Statute of <hi>Religioſis,</hi> 7 <hi>E.</hi> 1. and ſee 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>tr. Mortmain</hi> 39.

                     <hi>Manwood,</hi> Iuſtice; As to the commencement of Vſe, it hath been as long as mankind hath been guided by Reaſon: and although no mention is made of Vſes in our ancient Books, yet that is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Vſes have been but of late times. Vſes were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, therefore were not at all, is a <hi>Non ſequitur.</hi> As long as Wills have been, Truſt and Confidence hath been; and alſo as long as Marriage hath been. See the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Cauſa Matrimonii prolocuti:</hi> and ſee the Statute of <hi>Marlbridg, cap.</hi> 6. there is mention of <hi>falſa Feoffamenta:</hi> And note, by other words of the ſaid Statute there was a Truſt, but it was a falſe truſt to deceive another; and therefore ſuch a miſ-ſhapen Truſt is not called a Truſt by the ſaid Statute, but a Colluſion. And Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhall be sworn upon Enqueſts, which was not enacted by any Statute, but practiſed and put in ure by reaſon of Common Law. And I have ſeen divers ancient Deeds of Vſes: and in ancient time, you ſhall not find that any would purchaſe Lands to himſelf alone, but had two or three joint Feoffees with him; and he who was firſt named in the Charter of Feoffment, was <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> although that no Vſe was declared unto him upon the Livery, and ſo it was known by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of the Lands. And the reaſon why no mention is made in our ancient Books of Vſes, is, becauſe men were then of better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences than now they are, ſo as the Feoffees did not give occaſion to their Feoffors to bring <hi>Subpoena</hi>'s to compell them to perform the Truſts repoſed in them.</p>
                  <p>As to that which hath been ſaid, That Vſes have taken their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 3. For before the ſaid Statute, if a man had made a Feoffment in Fee without declaring any uſe, it ſhould be to the uſe of the Feoffee, becauſe there is a ſufficient conſideration betwixt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61358:13"/>
the Feoffor and Feoffee to raiſe the uſe, <hi>i.</hi> the Seignory crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Law betwixt them: but now by the ſaid Statute ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is taken away; and then upon ſuch Feoffment, without conſideration or declaration of uſe, it is to the uſe of the Feoffor himſelf; the ſame is no reaſon againſt them: for although that an Vſe implied was not before the ſaid Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 3. yet a Vſe expreſſed was; and if before the ſaid Statute the Feoffor had declared an Vſe; the ſame had been good: as at this day, a Gift in tail, or a Leaſe for life, is made to another uſe, yet notwithſtanding that the Law doth create a Tenure upon the Leaſe or Gift, yet the uſe expreſſed ſhall be good. And although Vſes are of ſuch Antiquity, yet they are not directed by the Rules of the common Law, but by the Will of the Owner of the Lands: For the Vſe is in his hands as clay is in the hands of the Potter which he in whoſe hands it is may put into what form he pleaſeth: And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that now the poſſeſſion be executed to the Vſe, yet the property and quality, as abſtracted from the poſſeſſion, ſhall not be drowned in the poſſeſſion: and ſo for as much as Vſes were by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Law guided at the wills of the parties, ſo alſo ſhall be the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: And ſo becauſe, That an uſe, as abſtracted from the poſſeſſion, might have been well limited to the Wife which ſhould be, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that at the time of ſuch limitation ſuch a one was not <hi>in eſſe,</hi> in the ſame manner it ſhall be now, when the poſſeſſion is preſently exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted to the uſe: and ſo in this caſe, the ſecond Wife ſhall be capable of this uſe, according to the will and direction of the Owner. If a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment in Fee be made to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> for life, and if <hi>A.</hi> before ſuch a day ſhall pay 10<hi>l.</hi> to the Feoffor, then to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> for life, the ſame is a good uſe to begin upon the ſaid condition; and yet if it had been limited in poſſeſſion, it had been otherwiſe: and that an Vſe may begin upon a contingency, ſee the caſe 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 5. A Covenant is made by Indenture betwixt <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> that the Son of <hi>A.</hi> ſhall marry the Daughter of <hi>B.</hi> upon which <hi>B.</hi> pays 100<hi>l.</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> and the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that if the ſaid marriage doth not take effect, that then the Feoffees of the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> ſhall ſuffer the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> his Executors and Aſſigns, to have the iſſues and profits of certain Lands, until <hi>B.</hi> his Executors and Aſſigns, ſhall be contented and ſatisfied of the ſum aforeſaid by the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> his Executors or Aſſigns, there, if the marriage doth not take effect, upon ſuch contingent, the uſe ſhall riſe to <hi>B.</hi> And ſee 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br. Feoffs to Uſes</hi> 50. <hi>A.</hi> covenants with <hi>B.</hi> that then <hi>B</hi> ſhall enfeoff <hi>A.</hi> of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> then <hi>B.</hi> and his Heirs ſhall be ſeiſed of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> and his Heirs: Now if <hi>A.</hi> enfeoffeth <hi>B. ut ſupra,</hi> then, <hi>&amp;c. vide librum.</hi> And here in our caſe, the ſecond Wife doth not hold joyntly with her Husband, for their Eſtates do not begin together, for the Husband is in of his ancient Eſtate which he had during the firſt marriage, notwithſtanding the words of limitation to the ſaid Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and his ſecond Wife, but ſhe ſhall take by way of Remainder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harper,</hi> Iuſtice, Vſes began about 18 <hi>E.</hi> 2. after which time there was ſuch a general liking of them, that they were anew uſed, but they did not come into common practice before the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, when the great contention fell out betwixt the two great Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> at which time Vſes were in great eſtimation for the ſafety of Inheritances. Afterwards, Vſes by practices became miſchievous, and prejudicial to the publick Iuſtice of the Realm, and to many particular perſons; for ſome <hi>timentes implacitari,</hi> conveyed their Lands ſecretly to uſes, ſo as he who had right knew not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom to bring his action: and for that, divers Statutes have been made to enable the Subject to implead the pernor of the profits, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 7. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 4. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And as to the making of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the truth is, that the King was diſpleaſed for the loſs of Wardſhips, and other injuries done to him; for which cauſe he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61358:13"/>
complained to the Iudges of the defect of the Law in that caſe who therefore ſhewed unto the King the cauſes of thoſe injuries and loſſes to the King; and farther ſhewed to the King, That if the poſſeſſion might be joyned to the uſe, all would go well, and all the injuries, wrong, and loſs, which came to the King by reaſon of ſuch Vſes, Wills, and ſecret Feoffments, would be avoided: For which the King commanded his Council to frame a Bill to that purpoſe, and preſent it to the Houſe of Commons in the <hi>24</hi> year of his Reign, but it was then rejected; and the King at that time would have been contented, that the fourth part of the Land onely ſhould deſcend: and from that time the King ſtayed farther proceedings in the ſaid cauſe until 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. at which time it took effect: And their cure was to pen the Statute ſo preciſely, that nothing ſhould be left in the Feoffees, but that the whole Eſtate ſhould be executed by the Statute, ſo as the ſaid Statute did utterly take out all from the Feoffees. Whereas it hath been ſaid, That a Vſe hath been as long as any Marriage hath been, and ſo conceived upon the Writ <hi>Cauſa Matrimonii prolocuti,</hi> the ſame is not any reaſon; for in that Caſe there is not any Confidence or Truſt: for if the marriage doth not take effect, the woman ſhall have her Writ <hi>de Cauſa Matrimonii prolocuti.</hi> In Conveyances we are to reſpect two things, the form, and the effect of it; and in all caſes where the form and the effect cannot ſtand together, the form ſhall be rejected, and the effect ſhall ſtand. A Leaſe for life is made to a Feme ſole, ſhe takes Husband, the Leſſor confirms to both of them; the Husband cannot take any Eſtate preſently according to the words of the Confirmation; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Will of the Leſſor is, that an eſtate ſhall accrue to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he ſhall have it as the Law will, by way of Remainder. So Lands are given to an Abbat and a ſecular man, the form of the words purport a joynt Eſtate, but that by Law cannot be; and therefore they ſhall take as the Law will, rather than not at all. In our caſe here, The limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vſe cannot be purſued preciſely according to the words, which are, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Husband over-live his ſaid firſt Wife, then to the uſe of the ſaid Husband and his Wife which ſhall be; which in words is a joynt Eſtate: and therefore the words ſhall be conſtrued, After the death of the firſt Wife, unto the uſe of the Husband until he marrieth, and afterwards to the uſe of him and his ſecond Wife, in which caſe they ſhall take joyntly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dyer,</hi> chief Iuſtice, As to the beginning of Vſes,<note place="margin">See Bacon's Reading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Stat.</note> he conceived that the ſame was immediately after the Statute of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> at which time all their ſhifts then in practice were found out: which ſee, the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> 7 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>Stat. de Religioſis:</hi> for which cauſe they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter driven to find out other ſhifts not provided for by the Statute, which were eſpyed by the making of the Statute of 15 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and in that Statute theſe words, <hi>Behoof</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> are uſed; which is the firſt place thoſe words have been uſed in our Law, and yet long time before that Statute Uſes had been in practice, as appeareth in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the which in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when the ſaid Record was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to the Iuſtices, the effect of which Record was, That <hi>Walter de Chirton,</hi> who was Cuſtomer of the King, became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the King in the ſum of 18000<hi>l.</hi> and with that the King's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had purchaſed in the name of his friends, to defraud the King, many Lands, and took the profits of them; thoſe Lands ſo purchaſed were extended to the uſe, and for the King, in payment of his Debt, as well as if <hi>Walter de Chirton</hi> himſelf had been ſeiſed of them, and that by the advice of the Chancellor and the chief Iuſtices. Now Vſes by tract of time have grown in credit, ſo as <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> have been sworn in Inqueſts, and by the Law they might juſtifie the maintaining of their Feoffees when they had been impleaded, which they could not have done if they had not more intereſt in the Lands than ſtrangers:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61358:14"/>
and they <hi>(Uſes)</hi> have been in ſuch reckoning and account ſince, that an Vſe hath obtained the name of an Inheritance, and is now reputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Eſtates of Lands in our Law; and therefore we ſay in Speeches, and in penning of Statutes, Eſtates in poſſeſſion, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in uſe: and a Vſe cannot be limited to Pariſhioners, no more than the Land it ſelf; ſo as there is a great affinity betwixt the words, <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Uſe.</hi> It is to be granted, That the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth deveſt all out of the Feoffees, yet it doth not deveſt it before that the uſe be veſted in <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe;</hi> for the words of the Statute are, That the poſſeſſion ſhall be executed in ſuch manner, quality, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as was the Vſe; therefore the veſting of the Vſe ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the execution of the poſſeſſion to it. And he was of opinion, That this future Vſe in the principal Caſe limited to the ſecond Wife did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Feoffees at the firſt, but that they had deſtroyed it by their Feoffment; for the ſecond Wife at the time of the Feoffment was not known, and therefore it ſhall now accrue: and he was alſo of opinion, That this limitation to the ſecond Wife was void at the beginning; for the ſecond Wife was not a perſon able to take, when the Eſtate and Vſe limited to the firſt Wife was determined, and therefore ſhe ſhall not take at all: and if ſuch an Eſtate had been limited in poſſeſſion, it ſhould not have veſted, no more than now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mounſon,</hi> Iuſtice; When the Feoffor and the Feoffees joyn in a Fine of that Land, within which the uſe in future is wrapped, he conceived, That the Vſe being in abeyance and conſideration of the Law, could not be touched by the Fine. It is to be confeſſed, That an Vſe may be diſcontinued: See 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 18. A Feoffment made to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> for life, and after to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> in tail, <hi>&amp;c. A.</hi> makes a Feoffment in Fee, and dieth, the ſame is a diſcontinuance of the other Vſes: and ſee 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 29. And in our Caſe, the Vſe might ariſe without any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Feoffees; for the Vſe is not diſcontinued, but the Feoffees are barred by the Fine: And he was alſo of opinion, That this Vſe might take effect without any Entry, and take effect according to the limitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manwood,</hi> This Eſtate which is limited in uſe to the ſecond Wife, becauſe it cannot veſt in her becauſe not known, the Feoffees are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it, and this Vſe is to grow out of their Eſtates at the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time: Then when they joyn in a Feoffment, their Eſtate which was the root of the Conveyance, and the Vſes which are the branches, ſpring not till ſhe dieth; and therefore if the Eſtate of the Feoffees, which is the root of the Vſes, be deſtroyed by alienation of the Land before the Vſes have their being, as in our Caſe it is, becauſe that then the ſecond was not known, no uſe can afterwards riſe, for by the Feoffment they are deſtroyed, and alſo every poſſibility of them. But if the Vſes had been <hi>in eſſe,</hi> ſo as the perſons to whom they are limited are known, then the Statute ſhall execute the poſſeſſion to ſuch uſes. And as to that which hath been objected by my Brother <hi>Mounſon,</hi> That the Law ſhall keep and preſerve the Vſe, and that notwithſtanding any thing done by the Feoffees at its due time it ſhall riſe: That cannot be; for the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not ſpeak of ſuch Vſes as this in our Caſe, but of ſuch Vſes onely, of which one may ſay, ſuch a uſe is limited to ſuch a perſon and ſuch to ſuch a perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch Vſes are onely executed by the Statute. It may be demanded, What Eſtate the Feoffees have in the Lands until ſuch uſes be executed? It may be anſwered, A Fee ſimple determinable, as the Lord hath when he entereth upon his Villein Donee in tail: And I conceive, That this uſe was not <hi>in Cuſtodia Legis, quia de minimis non curat Lex:</hi> and the uſe was ſuch a thing of which the Law took no knowledge; and in caſe of an Eſtate in poſſeſſion, ſuch an uſe in abeyance ſhould be bound: As a Leaſe for life unto <hi>A.</hi> the Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>B.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61358:14"/>
A.</hi> ſuffers a common Recovery in the life of <hi>B.</hi> who afterwards dieth, and afterwards <hi>A.</hi> dyeth, the Heir of <hi>B.</hi> is bound, for he had not right at the time of the Recovery. This Fine levied by the manner ſhall not deſtroy the uſes limited to the ſecond Wife; for as to the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees, they have nothing to doe with the Lands to transfer any Eſtate againſt the former limitation; for the Statute leaves nothing in the Feoffees, but veſts all in <hi>Ceſty que uſe,</hi> and that which cannot veſt in him to whom it is limited, ſhall return to the Feoffor: As if I make a Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of my ſelf for life, and after to the uſe of my ſecond Wife, all the Fee is now in me, and when I take a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wife, then the Feoffees ſhall be ſeiſed to the uſe of ſuch Wife in Remainder for her life: but in the Caſe at Bar, the Feoffees at the time when this ſecond Wife was <hi>in eſſe,</hi> had not any thing in the Lands, for they had departed with all their Intereſt before by their Feoffment and Fine.</p>
                  <p>Note, That by the firſt Feoffment the uſe was limited to <hi>D.</hi> the firſt Wife of the Feoffor, for term of her life, the Remainder in tail to <hi>A. Brent,</hi> the Remainder in Fee to one <hi>Broughton,</hi> and all theſe uſes were executed by the Statute; but theſe perſons were not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Livery, but onely the Feoffees, which had not any thing: Then when they make their Letter of Attorney to make Livery of ſeiſin (not being ſeiſed of the Land) the Attorney onely is a Diſſeiſor, and ſo nothing paſſed from the Feoffees, if any right had been in them: and for another reaſon nothing paſſed by this laſt Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of the Feoffees, for the parties to the latter Conveyance had notice of the uſe, and ſo it appeareth by the ſecond Indenture, the which makes mention of the firſt uſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dyer,</hi> Here in our Caſe, the Founders of theſe uſes, <hi>i.</hi> the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for and the Feoffees, have an intent to overthrow theſe uſes, for at the Common Law the Feoffees might doe it of themſelves; As if the Feoffees had made a Feoffment in fee in conſideration of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to others who had not notice of the uſes, now the uſes are gone, and the ſecond Feoffees in ſuch Caſes were ſeiſed to their own uſes. I well know, That by this Feoffment all is deveſted out of the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees, which might veſt in the perſon to whom the uſe is limited; but here this uſe which was limited to the ſecond Wife, could not upon the limitation of it veſt in any perſon; and therefore it ſhall remain in the Feoffees who are put in Truſt with it, and therefore have intereſt in the Lands until all the Truſts be performed: and therefore the ſecond Wife was adviſed by her Council to make her Entry in name of the ſurviving Feoffee, and the intereſt which the Feoffees have in the <hi>interim,</hi> untill the execution of all the uſes, is a Fee-ſimple determinable; for the whole intereſt is not deveſted or driven out of the Feoffees untill the whole Truſt be accompliſhed, <hi>i.</hi> untill all the uſes limited upon the Feoffment are executed, and have their full perfection.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it hath been alledged on the other ſide, That upon the ſecond Feoffment nothing paſſed out of the Feoffees, for which it ſhall not be ſaid in Law their Livery, but that the Attorney ſhall be ſaid the ſole Diſſeiſor; As to that I conceive, That whatſoever was loſt in the Feoffees paſſed by that Livery. If he in Reverſion upon an Eſtate for life makes a Charter of a Feoffment, and a Letter of Attorney to make Livery of ſeiſin without words <hi>ad expellendas omnes, &amp;c.</hi> if Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very be made by force thereof, the Fee-ſimple ſhall paſs: And he cited a Caſe which was argued before all the Iuſtices of <hi>England,</hi> reported by himſelf 2 and 3 <hi>Ma.</hi> 131. Divers Leaſes for years were made of the Demeans of an Abby, after which the Reverſion was granted to the Counteſs of <hi>Richmond</hi> for life, after which King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. granted the Reverſion in Fee to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who made a Feoffment of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61358:15"/>
all to certain perſons, to the uſe of his eldeſt Son and his Wife for her Iointure, with a Letter of Attorney to make Livery and ſeiſin; the Attorney made Livery accordingly, and by that Feoffment and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, it was adjudged, that the Fee-ſimple did paſs: So in our Caſe, upon this ſecond Feoffment, a Diſſeiſin is done to <hi>D.</hi> the firſt Wife, and yet the right of the Feoffees doth paſs thereby; and although it ſhall not be taken in Law their Livery, yet it ſhall be adjudged their confirmation, becauſe they have joined in the Deed, and that ſhall bind their right to eſtabliſh the ſame in the new Feoffees, as if the Diſſeiſee join in a Feoffee by Deed with the heir of the Diſſeiſor: And as to that which hath been objected, that becauſe at the time of the Feoffment, the Feoffees had not any thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore nothing ſhall paſs: and they have likened to the Caſe, where the Father is diſſeiſed, and the Son and heir doth releaſe to the Diſſeiſor, the ſame ſhall not bind the heir after the death of his Father: The ſame is not like our Caſe; for there is a great difference betwixt a Releaſe and a Feoffment; for if the Son diſſeiſe the Father, and maketh a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Fee in the life of his Father, notwithſtanding that he had not any right at the time of the Feoffment, yet he is bound.</p>

                     <note place="margin">3 Len. 171.</note> brought Debt for arrerages of Rent, reſerved upon a Leaſe for years, of certain Mines demiſed to <hi>Smith, i.</hi> Mines called <hi>Argil,</hi> and Mines cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Greenbourn;</hi> and it was againſt the Executors of <hi>Smith.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded, as to parcel <hi>non detinet,</hi> and as to the other parcel of the arrerages, That in the Indenture of Leaſe, there is a Covenant, That if it ſhall happen that the ſaid Leſſee be hindred, <hi>Quo minus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriis, praed. gaudere poſſit;</hi> That then ſo much Rent ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted <hi>anno,</hi> to the value of the Mine, that he could not enjoy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he ſaid, that he was hindred, <hi>Quo minus gaudere potuit Mineriis praed. &amp;c.</hi> and iſſue was joined, that the Leſſee could not enjoy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was found for the Plaintiff. It was moved by <hi>Coke,</hi> in arreſt of Iudgment, That here is not any place ſhewed where theſe Mines were, ſo as it doth not appear from what place the Viſne ſhould come; as if in an Action (as here) the Plaintiff declares of a Leaſe made of Lands, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>R.</hi> in ſuch a County, the ſame is not good. The iſſue here is, <hi>Non potuit fodere in praed. Minera de</hi> Greenbourn, for the ſpace of ſeven years and an half, from whence ſhall the Viſne come for trial of it? Not from <hi>Durham</hi> where the Leaſe was made; for no affinity or nearneſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the place where the Leaſe was made and this iſſue. But if the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue had been, That the Leſſor had not any thing in the Mines at the time of the Leaſe, that might be tried where the Leaſe was made: Another
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61358:16"/>
exception was, becauſe that the plea is; <hi>Quod non potuit fodere,</hi> in 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>dimidio,</hi> 10, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. and that appears to be ſeven years and a half, and the Iury find that he could not digg, <hi>per ſpatium ſeptem annorum tantum,</hi> without ſpeaking of the half year, and ſo they have not given a full Verdict: And as to the firſt Exception, it was ſaid, If a thing be alledged in pleading which is iſſuable, and there is not laid down any place of it, although that no iſſue be joined upon it, yet becauſe he hath prevented the other of his plea to it, Iudgment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in ſuch caſe ſhall be reverſed: and ſo it was rated, betwixt <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Stanſham:</hi> So upon the Statute of Vſury, the Informer charged the Defendant, that by way of corrupt bargain he hath received ſo much, and doth not ſhew the place, although no iſſue was joined upon it, but they were at iſſue upon another point, yet if Iudgment in ſuch caſe be given, it ſhall be reverſed. And in all Actions upon the Caſe, where Requeſt is neceſſary, and the Plaintiff ought to alledge it; the place of the Requeſt muſt be ſhewed: and he ſaid, That ſuch iſſue was to be tried where the Mines leaſed are; and here no place is alledged, where the Mines are, but onely in the County of <hi>Durham;</hi> and yet a Viſne of the City of <hi>Durham</hi> hath tried the iſſue, which ought not to have been, but the Viſne ought to have come, <hi>De Corpore Comitatus. Clark,</hi> Baron, If the iſſue be joined upon taking of the profits, it ſhall be tried where the Land is, but <hi>Non debet</hi> or <hi>detinet,</hi> where the Leaſe is made. <hi>Coke,</hi> The iſſue is, <hi>Non potuit fodere,</hi> and that is local; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be tried where the Mines are. <hi>Manwood, Non potuit fodere, Non potuit gaudere,</hi> are not local; but <hi>Non fodit, Non gaviſus fuit,</hi> is local, and ſhall be tried where the Mines are: and here it is not ſhewed how he was hindred to dig, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the iſſue is to be <hi>de poſtatia, non de actu. Tanfield,</hi> as to that which <hi>Coke</hi> hath ſaid, That the Viſne in this Caſe ſhall come, <hi>de corpore Comitatus,</hi> the ſame is not ſo, for ſuch a Viſne ſhall never be, but where the iſſue is upon <hi>Nul tiel vill hamlet,</hi> or place known: In another Caſe the trial ſhall be, <hi>de corpore Comitatus,</hi> as in a falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment the Defendant juſtifies, that the common voice and fame was, that the Plaintiff committed ſuch a Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Plaintiff traverſeth the common voice and fame, there the Viſne ſhall be, <hi>de cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Comitatus,</hi> 11 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4, and 5. and ſee alſo 25 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Caſe of <hi>Gynne</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> reported now in <hi>Coke,</hi> 6. part <hi>Dowdale</hi>'s Caſe, 48. As to the defect in the verdict for the half year, the Record is not ſo; for the Record is, <hi>dimidio anni decimi, &amp; undecimi,</hi> and ſo two half years make a whole year, and ſo there is but ſeven years in which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance is ſuppoſed to be done. See as to the Viſne, <hi>de corpore Comitatus,</hi> 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4 Viſne 27. Another Exception was taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Declaration is, That the Leaſe was made at <hi>Durham, in Comitatu Dunelm.</hi> and doth not ſay alſo in <hi>Selberg,</hi> for ſuch is the name of the County Palatine; but to that it was ſaid, That every <hi>Writ</hi> of Execution which goes into the County Palatine, is directed <hi>Epiſcopo Dunelmenſi, &amp; Cancellario ſuo, quod det in mandatis Vice-com. ſuo, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Durham</hi> was called <hi>Selberg</hi> in ancient times, and the name of the County Palatine there, is commonly <hi>Dunelm. &amp; Selberg.</hi> and their pleas there entred; <hi>Placita coram Juſticiariis de Dunelm. &amp; Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</hi> but the ſame is amongſt themſelves onely, and all directions from hence to them are <hi>Epiſcop. Dunelm.</hi> without mention of <hi>Selberg,</hi> and a Precedent was ſhewed to the Court to that purpoſe and intent. <hi>Manwood,</hi> Levied by diſtreſs, and <hi>iſſint rein arere</hi> ſhall be tried where the Leaſe was made: <hi>Clark,</hi> That is true, for by the <hi>(Iſſint)</hi> the plea before is waved: And ſee 8 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 10. Where an iſſue is to be tried in <hi>Lincoln,</hi> or ſuch a Town, which is a Franchiſe, the <hi>Ven. fac.</hi> ſhall be of <hi>Lincoln, &amp;c.</hi> and not <hi>de vicineto de Lincoln;</hi> for then the Iury ſhall be as well of the County adjacent, as of <hi>Lincoln</hi> it ſelf, which the Sheriff of <hi>Lincoln</hi> cannot doe: but a <hi>Venire facias de ſuburbiis</hi> of <hi>Briſtow</hi> was awarded good:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61358:16"/>
And if in the caſe at Bar, the defendant had pleaded, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant had entred into part of the Mines, and ſo ſuſpended his Rent, upon which they are at iſſue; that, by <hi>Manwood,</hi> ſhall be tried by a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>de corpore Comitatus.</hi> The iſſue here is, If the Defendant might enjoy thoſe Mines, <hi>Secundum veram intentionem dimiſſionis praedict.</hi> and that is referred to the Deviſe which was made at <hi>Durham,</hi> and there it is well triable. And afterwards, at another day it was holden, That all the iſſues are <hi>Jeofailes;</hi> but as to the want of place, the ſame was holden to be a material Exception. See the Caſe of Mynes, <hi>Plowd.</hi> 337. Exception was taken to the Information, becauſe it is not laid down there is what Town or Hamlet <hi>Newlands</hi> lay; and it was holden, the ſame had been a material Exception, if the Defendant had demurred upon the Information, in which caſe there is no trial by Iury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Miſnoſmer</hi> ſhall be tried where the <hi>Writ</hi> is brought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ne unque adminiſter</hi> as Executor, <hi>&amp;c. Manwood,</hi> Here the Leaſe is ſaid to be made at <hi>Durham,</hi> in a place certain; if now there be not any other local thing ſaid which might draw the trial elſewhere, it ſhall be tried at <hi>Durham</hi> where the Leaſe is made: An Infant makes a leaſe for years, rendring Rent, and afterwards re-enters, and avoids his Leaſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his nonage, and Title is made againſt him by the Leaſe, upon which he pretended nonage, it ſhall be tried where the Leaſe was made, and afterwards Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

And he ſaid, that it was the opinion of <hi>Dyer</hi> in that caſe, That the younger Son was inheritable to the ſaid Eſtate-tail: as in the Caſe of <hi>Littleton</hi> 82. where the condition is, That the Feoffee ſhall give the Lands to the Son and Heir of the Husband and Wife, and to the Heirs of the body of the Father and Mother lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: and the Husband and Wife before any ſuch Gift die, having iſſue, and afterwards the Feoffee gives the Land to the Son and Heir of the Husband and Wife, and to the Heirs of the body of the Father and Mother begotten, the condition is well performed: and if the eldeſt Son, to whom the Gift is made, dieth without iſſue, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son ſhall inherit: And in a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the Reverter, upon ſuch a Gift the <hi>Writ</hi> ſhall be, <hi>Et quae poſt mortem</hi> of the eldeſt Son, <hi>ad ipſum reverti debet;</hi> becauſe the Husband and Wife <hi>obierunt ſine haerede de corpor. ſuis inter eos exeunt.</hi> And ſuch was alſo the Opinion of <hi>Saunders.</hi> But <hi>Brook, Brown</hi> and <hi>Catlin</hi> were clear contrary; And he ſaid, that <hi>Bendloes</hi> Serjeant, who reporteth that Caſe, doth affirm, That Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given in that caſe, That the Eſtate-tail was ſpent, and that the Daughter ſhould have the Lands, and not the ſecond Son: and ſo he ſaid, That in the Caſe at the Bar, the Eſtate-tail was ſpent: But he ſaid, That he conceived that in the principal caſe at Bar there is not any Eſtate-tail at all, becauſe the words (upon which the Eſtate-tail is conceived) are incertain and too general, <hi>viz. [ſecundum antiquam Evidentiam,]</hi> for there might be many ancient Evidences, for the words may extend to Evidences which cut off the Eſtate tail, as well as to the Entail of <hi>Guntwardy.</hi> He alſo argued, That the Partition was void; and then the Leſſee had a good intereſt for certain parts of the Lands, for Partition cannot be made of an Vſe: and he ſaid, that he agreed, That Partition betwixt Husband and Wives of Lands, if it be equal, ſhould bind the makers, becauſe they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to make Partition of them; but contrary of an Vſe, for that they are not compellable to do: Alſo, in the principal Caſe, the Land entailed is allotted to one of the Coparcenors, which is not good but during the Coverture, and afterwards void; and then the Leaſe is void but in part, and ſo the Conuſance is not good.</p>

                     <hi>Atkinſon</hi> contrary; and he ſaid, I conceive, that by words of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Fee may paſs without the word <hi>Heirs.</hi> See 39 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 12. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeiſed of Lands in fee, doth enfeoff his younger Son in fee, and the Father continues the poſſeſſion of the Lands, claiming to hold them at the will of the Son; and the Son coming into the Town where the Lands do lie, in the hearing of his Neighbours ſaith to his Father, <hi>You have given to me theſe Lands, naming them; As fully as you have given them to me, I give them back to you again:</hi> and the ſame was holden to be a good Gift to the Father: 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 22. The King ſeiſed of a Manor, to which an advowſon is appendant by Eſcheat or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, gives the ſaid Manor as entirely as ſuch a one held the ſaid Manor before the Eſcheat or Conveyance, the Advowſon ſhall paſs without ſpecial mentioning of it: And ſo here in our Caſe at Bar; This Will hath reference to the ancient Evidence, and it ſhall be as ſtrong as if he had ſet down the ſpecial words of Entail; and to ancient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before the Entail it cannot extend, for then a fee ſhould paſs, and then the Deviſe ſhould be void, becauſe to his Heir; and the word <hi>Antiqua Evidentia</hi> ſhall have reference to the Charter which was made by <hi>Guntwardy,</hi> for that was an ancient Evidence made two hundred years paſt: and he cited the Caſe of 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8. the <hi>Provoſt</hi> of <hi>Beverley</hi>'s Caſe, and conceived that the Eſtate was not ſpent, for that the Eſtate-tail was in <hi>Jeofry,</hi> as the fee was in him. Lands are given to the Father for life, the Remainder to the Son in Tail, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the right Heirs of the Father; the Father dieth, the Tail and the fee are in the Son; but yet after the death of the Son with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue, the Lands ſhall be in the Brother's Son by deſcent, and not as Purchaſor. And in our Caſe, <hi>Jeofry</hi> was in in the Tail, as right Heir of <hi>Henry;</hi> and if <hi>Jeofry</hi> dieth without iſſue, his Brother of the half bloud ſhall have the Lands, as in the Caſe before cited of 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. but that ſhall be in Tail by force of the Deviſe. And he ſaid, That in this caſe here, the Partition was made good enough, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were of Lands in uſe, for a man might contract for an Vſe without Deed: 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Partition</hi> 156.

the Tithes of the ripe Tares, the tenth ſhock; but for their green Tares which are eaten up before they are ripe, in conſideration that they gave them to their Cattel, they had uſed to be diſcharged of any Tithes thereof; and the truth was, That 400 Acres of Lands within the ſaid Town had uſed to be plowed and ſowed every year by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of draught Cattel, and induſtry of the Inhabitants, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which, and that in the ſaid Pariſh there was not ſufficient Meadow nor Paſture for their draught Cattel, they had uſed to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of the Tithes of green Tares eaten before they were ripe: It was holden by the Court, that the ſame was a good cuſtome and conſideration, for the Parſon hath benefit thereby, for otherwiſe the ſaid 400 Acres could not be plowed; for without ſuch ſhift to eat with their draught Cattel the green Tares, they could not maintain their plough Cattel, and ſo the Parſon ſhould loſe his Tithes thereof; and for the Tithes of the green Tares, he hath the Tithes of 400 Acres.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Egerton,</hi> Solicitor General; The property is not altred; for the Bailor might have an Action of Account againſt <hi>Andrews</hi> before he hath delivered them over according to the Bailment; but if he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them over, the ſame is a good bar in Account: But if one be accountable to me upon a Bailment, and afterwards I require him to bail the goods over to <hi>A.</hi> the ſame is not in bar of the Account, but is a good Plea in diſcharge of Account before Auditors, for that is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after the Bailment, not upon the Bailment. If Goods be bailed to bail over upon a conſideration precedent on the part of him to whom they ought to be bailed, the Bailor cannot countermand it, otherwiſe it is where it is voluntary and without conſideration, but where it is in conſideration of a Debt not countermandable; contrary, if to ſatisfie the Debt of another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manwood,</hi> chief Baron: Where the Debtor of the King is ſufficient, there a Debt due to him ought not to be aſſigned to the King, but onely where the Debt is doubtfull, and that was the ancient courſe: but now at this day many ſeem and are accounted to be rich who are not, and therefore <hi>omnis ratio tentanda eſt</hi> to recover the Debts of the King. But as to the Caſe before us, <hi>Briget</hi> is Executrix to her Husband, who was indebted to <hi>Archdel,</hi> and ſhe delivered the Goods to <hi>Andrews</hi> to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>Archdel,</hi> and all that before the Aſſignment. And I conceive that the property of the ſaid Goods is altered; for, as the caſe is here, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> was Surety for <hi>Clark,</hi> and had a Counter-Bond of <hi>Clark</hi> to ſave him harmleſs. If I borrow Money, and deliver Plate for the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, the general property is in me, yet the Bailee hath a ſpecial intereſt in it, till the Money is paid. If Goods be delivered to <hi>A.</hi> to pay to <hi>B. A.</hi> may ſell them. An Executor hath Goods of the Teſtator, and he with his own Monies pays the Debts of the Teſtator, he ſhall retain the Goods, and the property is altered. And here in our Caſe, <hi>Andrews</hi> might by virtue of the Bailment ſell the Goods, and with the Money pay the ſaid <hi>Archdel.</hi> And afterwards Iudgment was given, That the property of the Goods was altered.</p>

                  <p>IN an Information upon Intruſion againſt <hi>Norris</hi> and others concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Folly John Park,</hi> the Defendants pleaded in Bar a deſcent: It was holden clearly by the Court, That againſt the <hi>Queen</hi> a Deſcent is no Plea, nor any Title againſt the <hi>Queen,</hi> becauſe <hi>nullum tempus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currit Regi:</hi> neither ſhall Lacheſs be imputed to her: for the poſſeſſions of the <hi>Queen</hi> are large, and it is not reaſon that ſhe ſhould be bound or tyed to look to her affairs concerning her poſſeſſions, or to incur any damage in default thereof; for ſhe is to intend and manage the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs of the Kingdom and State. It was alſo held by the Court, That in pleading of a Leaſe for life, or Feoffment, the party needs not to ſhew the place where the Leaſe or Feoffment was made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> the <hi>Queens</hi> Attorny, took Exception to the Bar to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, That whereas in the Information Title is made to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and concludes, <hi>prout patet per plurima Recorda &amp; memoranda Scaccarii;</hi> the Defendants have not Traverſed it by ſaying, <hi>Abſque hoc quod habetur aliquod tale Recordum,</hi> To which it was ſaid by <hi>Harris</hi> and <hi>Savil,</hi> Serjeants, That if a ſpecial Record had been alledged in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61358:21"/>
then we ought to have taken ſuch Traverſe; but here it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the generalty, we ought not to traverſe at all. <hi>Manwood,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Information is general, <hi>i. ut patet per plurima Recorda,</hi> ſo the Traverſe ought to be alſo.</p>
                  <p>Another Exception was taken to the Bar, becauſe in the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Title of the <hi>Queen</hi> is ſet forth: and the Defendants plead, That long before the Intruſion <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee, and enfeoffed <hi>B.</hi> who died ſeiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where it might be that the Title of <hi>A.</hi> was mean betwixt the Title of the <hi>Queen</hi> and the Intruſion: whereas by <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> and <hi>Popham</hi> they ought to have ſaid, <hi>Diu antequam</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> was ſeiſed, <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed, <hi>&amp;c. Savil</hi> and <hi>Harris,</hi> If which ſhould ſo plead, we ſhould confeſs that the <hi>Queen</hi> once had a Title, and that is not true, which <hi>Manwood</hi> denied, for by ſuch Plea nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. And it was ſaid by ſome, That where in the Bar the Title of the <hi>Queen</hi> is confeſſed and avoided, there the Defendant ſhall ſay, <hi>Diu antequam</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> had any thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwiſe not. And it was holden by all, That in ſuch caſe, a Feoffment might be an induction unto a Traverſe, but not a Deſcent. And by <hi>Manwood,</hi> it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule, as well in the caſe of a Subject, as in the caſe of the <hi>Queen,</hi> That nothing can be an Inducement to a Traverſe, but ſuch a thing as is Traverſable; and here the Deſcent induceth the Traverſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not Traverſable in this caſe. Alſo it was holden, That the place where the party dieth ſeiſed needs not to be ſhewed in pleading a Deſcent. And afterwards <hi>Manwood</hi> at another day, <hi>mutata opinione,</hi> conceived, That as to <hi>plurima Recorda,</hi> there needed no Traverſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were many preſidents to the contrary: <hi>Diu ante tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem fieri ſup.</hi> is a good Plea in Treſpaſs in Caſe of a common perſon, not in the King's Caſe, <hi>diu ante Intruſionem, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>IN the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> upon the Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for levying of the King's Debts: A Debt came to the <hi>Queen</hi> by Attainder of the Creditor, upon which an <hi>Extent</hi> iſſued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one of the Ter-tenants liable to the Debt, and not againſt all: It was moved, That upon a branch of the ſaid Statute, all the Ter-tenants ought to be charged: But it was the Opinion of divers, that ſuch a Debt which cometh to the King by Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is not within the ſaid Statute; for although the Attainder is by a Iudgment, yet Debt by Iudgment it cannot properly be ſaid, but where a Debt is recovered by Iudgment.

It was firſt moved, If here the Leſſee for years had a new intereſt accrued to him by the Will? If it ſhall veſt in him as an intereſt by it ſelf, or that both Eſtates, as well the former Leaſe, as the Eſtate for years deviſed by the Will, ſhould be united by way of Surrender? Another matter was becauſe that the Deviſe is yielding ſuch Rent, and under ſuch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now becauſe the meaning of the Deviſor was, That the Deviſee ſhould hold over the Land for the term encreaſed as he held before; if here the Law ſhall give conſtruction to this Deviſe as near the intention of the Deviſor as it may be? and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue the words of the Will to amount to a condition. But by the Opinion of the whole Court, the words of the Deviſe cannot make a Condition; for a Condition is a thing odious in Law, which ſhall not be created without ſufficient words. Another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was moved, If the Fee-ſimple ſhould paſs by this Deviſe in point of Reverſion, or Remainder? And by the better opinion of the Court, it ſhall paſs in point of Reverſion; for if it ſhould be a Remainder, then the Rent which is reſerved upon the Leaſe by the Will, ſhall not be incident to ſuch Remainder, and therefore the Law ſhall qualifie it into a Fee-ſimple. Another matter was moved; Admitting that the words of the Deviſe, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> are Condition, If here in this Caſe there be a Grantee of the Reverſion intended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. As <hi>A.</hi> ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, deviſeth them to <hi>B.</hi> for years, rendering Rent, with clauſe of Re-entry; and by the ſame Will deviſeth the Reverſion to another: If becauſe that it was never in the Deviſor a Reverſion or a Condition? If
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61358:22"/>
the Deviſee be within the ſaid Statute to take advantage of it? And the Opinion of the whole Court was, That the Deviſee of the Fee-ſimple ſhould take advantage of this Condition.</p>

Owen</hi> Serjeant to the ſame purpoſe: He hath not alledged, <hi>Quantum, vel in quanto defecit,</hi> If there had been but a Pint, it had been ſufficient; The Information goes farther, <hi>Non defalcavit tantum de pretio, quantum defecit,</hi> and ſo <hi>tantum, &amp; quantum,</hi> is incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly laid; 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. If <hi>A.</hi> be bound to <hi>B.</hi> to make him a ſufficient Eſtate in ſuch Lands, in an Action brought upon ſuch an Obligation, it is no plea to ſay, That he hath made unto him a ſufficient Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he ought to ſhew what Eſtate, So 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4.

                  <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione Firmae,</hi> it was found by ſpecial Verdict,<note place="margin">Owen Rep. 88. 3 Len. 165,</note> That King <hi>E.</hi> 6. was ſeiſed of the Manor and hundred of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> and by his Letters Patents granted the ſame to <hi>Barnard</hi> in Fee, rendering 130<hi>l. per annum,</hi> and alſo to hold by Homage and Fealty; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reciting the ſaid Grant by <hi>E.</hi> 6. and the Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon it granted to <hi>Gartrude,</hi> Marchioneſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Manor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> and the ſaid Rents and Services; and alſo the Manor of <hi>Camfield,</hi> and other Lands and tenements, to be holden by the twentieth part of a Knight's Fee: <hi>Gertrude</hi> ſo ſeiſed, deviſed to

the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> the Manor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> the Manor of <hi>Camfield, &amp;c.</hi> and alſo bequeathed divers ſums of money to be levied of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes: and they farther found, That the ſaid Rent of 230<hi>l.</hi> was the full third part of the yearly value of all the Lands and Tenements of the Deviſor. The Queſtion was, If by thoſe words of the Deviſe, <hi>Of the Manor of Fremmington,</hi> the Rent and Services of the Manor did paſs? <hi>i.</hi> the Rent and the Homage and the Fealty reſerved, the Grant of King <hi>E.</hi> 6. of the Manor and Hundred of <hi>Fremmington?</hi> and if the ſaid Rent and Services are iſſuing out of the Manor? for if the Rent doth not paſs, then the ſame is deſcended to the Heir of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then being found the full and third part of the value, the King and the Heir is fully anſwered and ſatisfied, and then the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the reſidue diſcharged, and ſettled in the Deviſee: And if the Rent doth not paſs, then is the Heir of the Marchioneſs entitled by the Statute to a third part of the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> Serjeant, If the Marqueſs had deviſed by expreſs words the ſaid Rent and Services, they could not have paſſed: for as to the Services, they are entire things, as Homage and Fealty, and they cannot paſs by Deviſe in caſe where Partition is to follow, for ſuch things cannot receive any Partition or Diviſion, therefore they are not diviſible; for the Statute doth enable the Proprietor or Owner to deviſe two parts of his Inheritances, in three parts to be divided; <hi>i.</hi> as <hi>Catalla Felonum</hi> cannot be deviſed for the reaſon aforeſaid; which was granted by the whole Court. And as to the Deviſe, he argued much upon the grounds of Deviſes, and put a ground put by <hi>Fineax,</hi> 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. where every Will ought to be conſtrued and taken according as the words do import, or as it may be intended or implyed by the words, what the meaning of the Teſtator was out of the words of the Will. See thereof a good Caſe 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 8. and 9. and he relied much upon the Caſe of <hi>Bret</hi> and <hi>Rigden, Plow.</hi> 342. So he ſaid in this caſe, becauſe the intent of the Deviſor doth not appear upon the words of the Will, that this Rent ſhould paſs; it ſhall not paſs, for there is not any mention made of any Rent in all the Will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fenner</hi> contrary, and he argued much upon the favorable conſtruction which the Law gives to Wills, 14 <hi>H.</hi> 3. Reverſion for Remainder, <hi>&amp; è contr.</hi> 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8. A man may make a Feoffment of a Manor by the name of a Knights Fee, <hi>à fortiori</hi> in caſe of the Deviſe: and in our caſe the Marquiſs conceived, That the Rent and Services reſerved out of the Manor of <hi>Fremmington</hi> was the Manor of <hi>Fremmington;</hi> and the Law ſhall give ſtrength to that intention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walmſly</hi> conceived, That the Rent did not paſs by the name of Manor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this Rent, <hi>nec in rei veritate,</hi> nor in reputation, was ever taken for a Manor: Alſo the words, <hi>Of the Manor and Hundred of Fremmington,</hi> are put amongſt others which are Manors in truth; by which it ſeemeth, That the Deviſor did not intend to paſs but one Manor, and no other Hereditaments, by that Manor of <hi>Frem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington.</hi> It is a Rule in Law, That in the conſtruction of a Will a thing implyed ſhall not controul a thing expreſſed: But here, if by implication the Rent ſhall paſs, then the Manor of <hi>Camfield</hi> ſhall not paſs, which it was the intent of the Deviſor to paſs, and that by expreſs words, See 16 <hi>Elizab. Dyer</hi> 330. <hi>Clatche</hi>'s Caſe: and ſee 16 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 333. <hi>Chapman</hi>'s Caſe. But in our Caſe here, there are not any ſufficient words to warrant any implication; for neither in truth nor in reputation was it taken to be a Manor: 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 2. Green Acre might paſs by the name of a Manor, although it were but one Acre of Land, becauſe known by the name of a Manor. See accordingly 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 39. And ſee, where, before the Statute of Vſes, a man had Recoverors to his uſe, and he wills by his Will, That his Truſtees ſhould ſell his Lands, they may ſell. And he ſaid, That if a man ſeiſed of a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61358:26"/>
Manor parcell in Demeſne, and parcell in ſervice, and he grants the Demeſnes to one and his Heirs, and afterwards deviſeth his Manor, peradventure the ſervices ſhall paſs; but this Rent hath no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to a Manor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gawdy,</hi> This Rent ſhall paſs by the name aforeſaid. Favourable conſtruction is to be always given to Wills, according to the intent of the Deviſor, and no part of a Will ſhall be holden void, if by any means it may take effect; then here it appeareth, that his meaning was, that upon theſe words every thing ſhould paſs to the Deviſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaid Manor of <hi>Fremmington;</hi> for otherwiſe, the words of the Manor of <hi>Fremmington</hi> ſhould be void and frivolous, which ſhall not be in a Will, if any reaſonable conſtruction can be; for it is found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by the Iury, That neither at the time of the Will made, nor at the time of the death of the Deviſor, the ſaid Deviſor had any thing in the ſaid Manor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> but onely the ſaid Rent of one hundred and thirty pounds. And it may well be taken that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor being ignorant what thing a Manor is, though that the Rent was a Manor, becauſe that he had Rents and ſervices out of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. For in conſtruction of Wills, the words ſhall ſerve the intent of the party; and therefore if a man deviſeth, That his Lands ſhall be ſold for the payment of his debts, his Executors ſhall ſell them, for the intent of the Teſtator naming the Vendors, is ſufficient: And ſee <hi>Plowden,</hi> 20 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>L.</hi> after the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. deviſeth that his Executors ſhall be ſeiſed to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> and his Heirs in Fee, whereas then there was no Feoffees to his uſe; the ſame was holden a good Deviſe of the Lands of <hi>A.</hi> and the Iudges conceived, that the Deviſor was ignorant of the operation of the Statute in ſuch caſe, and therefore his ignorance was ſupplied: See <hi>Br. Deviſes,</hi> 44. 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>A.</hi> had Feoffees to his uſe, and afterwards, after the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. willed that his Feoffees ſhould make an Eſtate to <hi>B.</hi> and his Heirs, it was holden by <hi>Baldwin, Shelley</hi> and <hi>Mountague,</hi> Iuſtices, that it was a good Deviſe: See 26 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Feoff.</hi> 12. A Carve of Lands may paſs by the name of a Manor, <hi>Ergo, à multo fortiori,</hi> Rent, for Rents and Services have more nearneſs, and do more reſemble a Manor than a Carve of Lands; and it cannot be intended, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Teſtator was to grant the Manor it ſelf, in which ſhe had nothing, eſpecially by her Will; for covin, colluſion, or indirect dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhall not be preſumed in a Will: Alſo the <hi>Marchioneſs,</hi> for four years together before her death, had the Rent and Services of the ſaid Manor, and ſhe well knew, that ſhe had not any other thing in the ſaid Manor, but the ſaid Rent and Services; and therefore it ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that that was her Manor of <hi>Fremmington, A.</hi> ſeiſed of a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Meſſuage, and great Demeſnes lying to it, leaſeth the ſame for years, rendring Rent, and afterward deviſeth to another all his Farm, lying in ſuch a place, It was rated in that caſe, that by that Deviſe, the Rent and the Reverſion ſhould paſs: See the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Worſelie</hi> and <hi>Adams, Plowd.</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 195. by <hi>Anthony Brown</hi> and <hi>Dyer. Periam,</hi> Iuſtice, was of opinion, that this Rent might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided well enough; But by <hi>Anderſon,</hi> It is but Rent-ſeck; but <hi>Periam</hi> ſaid, it was a Rent diſtrainable of common Right, but all of them agreed, that the Rent might be divided, but there ſhould not be two Tenures. And the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> being adviſed that this Rent did not paſs by the Grant, but deſcended to the Heir, being the full part of the whole, entred into all the reſidue of the Lands, and made a Leaſe of the Manor of <hi>Camfield</hi> unto the Plaintiff, upon which entry, the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectione firmae</hi> was brought, and afterwards the Plaintiff ſeeing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Court to be againſt him, and for the Deviſee of the Rent by the name aforeſaid, did afterward diſcontinue his ſuit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Defendant ſaid, that the houſe in which the Plaintiff did inhabit in the ſaid Town, and by reaſon of reſidency in which Houſe he claimed common, was a new houſe erected within 30 years; and that before that time, there had not been any houſe there, upon which the Plaintiff did demurr: <hi>Shuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> Serjeant, argued for the Plaintiff, That he ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon there by reaſon of reſiancy in the ſaid new houſe; and he ſaid, that the Reſiancy is the cauſe, and not the Land, nor the perſon thereof; and thereupon he put the Caſe of 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 29. And he agreed the Caſe, That if the Lord doth improve part of the common, that he ſhall not have common in the reſidue of the Land, for the Lands improved, becauſe, That he cannot preſcribe for that which is improved, as the Book is, in 5 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> But here in the principal Caſe he doth not preſcribe in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon certain, or in, or for any new thing; but he ſets forth that the uſe of the Town hath always been, that the inhabitants ſhould have common there, And this common is not common appendent, or appertinent, but common in groſs, See <hi>Needham,</hi> 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 34. <hi>b.</hi> And he ſaid, That if the houſe of a Freeholder, which hath uſed to have ſuch common, doth fall down, and he erecteth a new houſe in another place of the Land, that he ſhall have common to that new erected houſe as he had before? And he took a difference betwixt the caſe of <hi>Eſtovers,</hi> where a new Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is erected, and this Caſe, and he ſtood much upon the manner of the preſcription. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Serjeant, contrary, And he took exception to the preſcription; For he ſaid, that it is ſaid therein; That it is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua Villa,</hi> but he doth not ſay, that it hath been ſo time out of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo it ought to be ſaid, as the Book is in 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>a.</hi> And then, if it be not an ancient Town time out of mind, the parties cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe as Inhabitants of the ſaid Town, to have common time out of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he ſaid, That if ſuch a preſcription as is ſaid in this Caſe be good in Law, <hi>viz.</hi> That every one who erected a new houſe within the ſaid Town, ſhould have common to his ſaid new houſe, the ſame ſhould be prejudicial to the ancient Town, and to the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and manifeſt impairing of the common there; and it might ſo happen, that one who had but little Lands in the ſaid Town, might erect twenty new houſes there, and ſo an infinite number of houſes might be newly erected there; and there ſhould be common allowed to every Inhabitant within the ſaid new erected houſes, which ſhould be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and unreaſonable. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> chief Iuſtice, He who erects a new houſe, cannot preſcribe in the common, for then a preſcription might begin at this day, which cannot be; and he inſiſted much upon the general loſs which ſhould happen to the ancient Tenants, if ſuch a preſcription for new erections ſhould be good. <hi>Periam,</hi> If it ſhould be Law, That he ſhould have common in this Caſe, That all the benefit which the Statute gives to the Lord for improvement, ſhould be taken away by ſuch new edifications and erection of new houſes, which were not reaſonable; And ſuch was the opinion of the other Iuſtices, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61358:27"/>
therefore they all agreed, that in the principal Caſe, the Plaintiff ſhould not have common to this new erected houſe; but the entry of the Iudgment was reſpited untill the Court had ſeen the Record, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſeen and conſidered upon the Record, <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> were of opinion as before: But <hi>Windham</hi> did not encline to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but they all agreed, That he who ſet up again a new Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney where an old one was before, ſhould have Eſtovers to the ſaid new Chimney: and ſo if he build a new houſe upon the foundation of an old houſe, That he ſhould have common to his ſaid houſe new erected: So if a houſe falleth down, and the Tenant or Inhabitant ſets up a new houſe in the ſame place: Alſo if a man hath a Mill, and a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to it time out of mind, which he hath uſed time out of mind to cleanſe, if the Mill falleth, and he erecteth a new Mill there, he ſhall have the Watercourſe, and liberty to cleanſe it, as it had before, and afterwards the ſame Term, Iudgment was given for the Defendant, to which <hi>Windham,</hi> Iuſtice, agreed.</p>

                  <p>THE Caſe was large, but the points in this Caſe were but two:<note place="margin">Owen Rep. 27. 4 Co. 24.</note> The firſt was, If Tenant <hi>per auter vye,</hi> after the death of <hi>Ceſtuy que vye</hi> holdeth over. If he be a Diſſeiſor or not: The ſecond point was, If Tenant at will, or at ſufferance, be ſuch a Tenant of the Manor as he may grant Copyhold Eſtates to Copyholders: For the firſt point; It was agreed by <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and he held, that the principal Caſe was, That if Tenant <hi>pur auter vye</hi> holdeth over the life of <hi>Ceſtuy que vye,</hi> that he thereby gaineth the Fee; But he granted the Caſes, That where a man holdeth at the will of another, that after the Eſtate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, if he holdeth over, he hath not thereby gained fee, for he is Tenant at ſufferance; and as <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith in his Chapter of Relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 108. Tenant at ſufferance, is where a man of his own head occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth the Lands and Tenements at the will of him who hath the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; and ſuch an occupier claims nothing but at will; But he ſaid, That in the principal Caſe, he otherwiſe claimed than at the will of the Leſſor; for that it appeareth, that he hath granted Copy: and he ſaid, that this difference doth give answer to the Caſe which is, <hi>t. H.</hi> 8. <hi>br. t. per</hi> Copy 18. where it is ſaid for Law, That none is Tenant at ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but he who firſt enters by authority of Law: As if a man makes a Leaſe for years, or for the life of another, and he holdeth the Lands after his term expired, or after the death of <hi>Ceſtuy que vye;</hi> If he claim nothing but at the will of him who hath the Freehold; he is a Tenant at ſufferance. But if he holdeth in the Lands againſt the will of his Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, then he is a Diſſeiſor; and ſo if he do act after ſuch continuance of poſſeſſion, contrary to the will of his Leſſor, he is a Diſſeiſor, 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. If an Infant maketh a Leaſe at will, and the Leſſor dieth, and the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee continueth in poſſeſſion, and claims Fee, the Heir ſhall have <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danceſter,</hi> 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. If <hi>Ceſtuy que vye</hi> dieth, and the Tenant hold in, and was impleaded, The Leſſor ſhall not be received, and he conceived the reaſon of the Caſe to be, becauſe that the reverſion was not in him; but that the Fee was gained and reſted in the other, 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 39. <hi>g.</hi> by <hi>Huſſey.</hi> If a Termor holdeth over his term, there an Eſtate in Fee is confeſſed to be in him, becauſe he holdeth the poſſeſſion of the Lands by wrong; but there is a <hi>Quaere</hi> made of it, if he be a Diſſeiſor or not, but I conceive that he is, for Treſpaſs doth not lie againſt him, before the Leſſor hath made his entry; and therefore, if the Leſſee doth continue in the poſſeſſion of the Lands by reaſon of the firſt entry; that is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61358:28"/>
reaſon, as I conceive, that the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Entre ad terminum qui praeteriit,</hi> lieth againſt ſuch a Termor, who holds ſo over his Term; and that <hi>Writ</hi> is a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> which doth not lie but againſt a Tenant of the Freehold. And ſuch is the opinion of <hi>Tilney,</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 43. That if the Guardian holds in the Lands at the full age of the Heir; or if the Tenant for years after the term expired, holdeth over the Lands, their Eſtates ſhall be adjudged a Fee. And in our Caſe here, he doth not claim to hold in at the will of the Leſſor; for he hath done an act contrary to the will of the Leſſor; For he being Lord of the Manor, in manner as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,<note place="margin">3 Cro. 302.</note> hath granted Eſtates by Copy; and it is holden, 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 12. by all the Iuſtices, That if Tenant at will, or Tenant at ſufferance at will, makes a Leaſe for years, that the ſame is a Diſſeiſin to the Leſſor, and the Tenant at will thereby gains the Freehold: and the reaſon of the Book ſeems to be, becauſe he claims to hold a greater Eſtate than of right belongs unto him. The ſecond point was, If Tenant at ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance might grant Copies, and he ſaid, that he might, and ſuch grant ſhould be good, becauſe he is in by lawfull means, and an Aſſiſe doth not lie againſt him, as in the Book of 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 38. before, and he is <hi>Dominus pro tempore.</hi> And this Caſe is not like to the Caſes, where Copies are made by Abators or Diſſeiſors; for the Law doth adjudge, that Copies made or granted by them are void, and his act here as a Tenant at ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of making and granting of the Copies ſtands with the cuſtome of the Manor which warrants them; as in the Caſe of <hi>Grisbrook</hi> and <hi>Fox,</hi> if an Adminiſtrator made by the Ordinary ſells the goods of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; and with the money thereof ariſing, payeth the debts of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and afterwards he who was made Executor proves the Will, he ſhall not avoid ſuch ſale of the goods, becauſe he hath made it according to Law, and hath done no more than an Executor is compelled to doe: So 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>b.</hi> If a Baily cut down trees to repair an ancient pail, the ſame is good: So 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>b.</hi> If he payeth a Quit Rent, it is good. And note, 4 <hi>Mariae Br.</hi> Tenant by Copy, 27. That the Leſſee of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in which there are Copyholds, after the death of the Copyholder, may admit the Heir of the Copyholder to the Land; and ſo he may doe, who hath but an Eſtate in the Manor <hi>durante bene placito:</hi> and yet it ſeems by the Book, that ſuch a Tenant of the Manor, cannot reſerve and leſſen Rent, but he ought to reſerve the ancient Rent, or more. <hi>Coke</hi> contrary; And firſt he ſaid, that he who holdeth over the life of the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> doth not gain any Fee where he comes in firſt by right, for that he is but Tenant at ſufferance, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 57. in the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Zouch, Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> for life, the remainder over in tail makes Leaſe for life of the Leſſee, he dieth, the Leſſee continueth his Eſtate, and the opinion of the Iuſtices of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and of others was, that he is but a Tenant at ſufferance, for the Leaſe was not any diſcontinuance of the Remainder, becauſe he had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. to make a Leaſe, and that is intended of ſuch Eſtate which he might lawfully doe; and this is our Caſe, and ſo it is adjudged already. As to the ſecond point, I grant, that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for years, or at will, or at ſufferance is <hi>Dominus pro tempore,</hi> but there is a difference as unto granting of Copies by them: For it was adjudged 25 <hi>Eliz.</hi> that they might grant Copies which are to be granted upon ſurrenders, made by Copyholders: As if a Copyholder doth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to the uſe of another, they may accept of ſuch a ſurrender, and grant the Lands by Copy to him to whoſe uſe the ſurrender is made; But if a Copyholder dieth, they cannot grant voluntary Copies <hi>de novo.</hi> And he ſaid that <hi>Popham,</hi> who argued the ſaid Caſe in 25 <hi>Eliz.</hi> That this difference was agreed, and ſo adjudged in one <hi>Sleer</hi>'s Caſe. And ſo 17 <hi>El.</hi> in the Caſe of one <hi>Stowley,</hi> where the Caſe was, That a Manor was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to one, and the Deviſee entred and granted Copies, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was found that the Deviſe was void, and it was there holden
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61358:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Copies made by ſuch Deviſee upon ſurrenders, were good, and were not to be avoided; but contrary of Copies made after the death of Tenants upon voluntary grants. I grant, that when <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> dieth, the Eſtate for life is utterly void and gone; and therefore he is in by wrong, but he cannot thereby gain ſo great an Eſtate as a Diſſeiſor, becauſe he came in at the firſt by right. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Tenant at will, and Tenant at ſufferance; for Tenant at will ſhall have aid, but contrary, of Tenant at ſufferance, as the Book is, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. a Releaſe to Tenant at will is good, contrary to Tenant at ſufferance; when after the death of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> he holdeth over, he hath ſome intereſt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to this purpoſe, that he ſhall not be a wrong doer, for he is neither Abator nor Deſſeiſor, therefore not a wrong doer, and then if he be in by a right, or rightfully, he is then <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus pro tempore,</hi> and then the grants made by him by Copy are good. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 3.

                  <p>IN an Information upon the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by <hi>Taylor</hi> againſt <hi>Brounſal,</hi> the Caſe was, That <hi>John Brounſal</hi> was ſeiſed, and gave the Lands to <hi>T.

                  <p>IN Debt for Arrerages of Rent, by <hi>Morgan</hi> againſt <hi>Chandler,</hi> It was found by ſpecial Verdict, That the Land out of which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by an Act of Parliament to the Marchioneſs of <hi>Northampton</hi> for the term of her life, the remainder to the Lady <hi>Bourcher,</hi> her daughter, and the heirs males of her body, the remainder to King <hi>H.</hi> 8. in Fee; And it was ordained by the ſame Act, <hi>Quod omnes conceſſiones &amp; dimiſſiones, Anglice,</hi> Grants and Leaſes, <hi>factae vel in poſterum fiendae,</hi> by the ſaid Marchioneſs, of the Lands aforeſaid, <hi>per ſcript.

The Lady <hi>Bourcher</hi> died without Iſſue, the Marchioneſs died; and if the Leaſe ſhould now bind the Queen, was the Queſtion: And it was moved by <hi>Clark</hi> of <hi>Lincoln's-Inn,</hi> That it ſhould, for the King was party to the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and thoſe Eſtates for life in Tail, and in Fee, are all as one Eſtate, and derived out of one Eſtate, and the Eſtate of the King is bound with the Leaſe; and it was moved by <hi>Broughton,</hi> That the Leaſe ſhould not bind the Queen, and ſo by conſequence not her Patentee; and he cited a Caſe, adjudged upon a like Act, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Statute of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which it was enacted, That the Lady <hi>Katharine,</hi> Wife of the ſaid King, ſhould be as a Feme ſole, and that ſhe might make Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In that caſe, the Leaſes ſhould not bind the King or his ſucceſſours; for the ſaid Act did not extend to make the Leaſes good, but onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Coverture. And it was obſerved by <hi>Clench,</hi> Iuſtice, that in the Act of Parliament now in queſtion, It is expreſly provided, that the Rent reſerved by the Marchioneſs, ſhould go to the lady <hi>Bourcher,</hi> but no proviſion made, that it ſhould go to the King, and therefore it is not reaſon that the King ſhould be bounden: But another matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing upon the pleading, the point did not fall in judgment.</p>

Land conveyed to the Husband for life, the Remainder to the Wife in tail, the Remainder to the Right Heirs of the Husband and Wife; The Husband and Wife ſuffer a common Recovery, the Husband hath iſſue and dieth, and afterwards the Wife dieth, the iſſue ſhall avoid the Leaſe and Recovery. See alſo the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Hare</hi> and <hi>Snow, Plow.</hi> 20 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 514. where a common Recovery was had againſt Tenant in tail, and his Wife, whereas in truth the Wife had nothing in the Land whereof the Recovery was ſuffered: It was holden, that the iſſue in tail, or any other perſon, might ſhew the truth of the matter; for he ſhall not be bound by any Eſtoppel which his Father hath admitted, by joyning in Voucher with his Wife, for he is not ſubject to the Eſtoppel; and therefore it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, That if the Wife in ſuch caſe might ſue Execution to have in value, yet the Son in tail might ouſt him of it. So 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 122. a <hi>Praecipe</hi> is brought againſt Tenant in tail, who prays in aid of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as Tenant for life, who enters into the aid, and bars the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, and afterwards the Tenant in tail dieth; his iſſue is at large to claim the Eſtate-tail, although the mouth of his Father was eſtopped as to it. So Tenant in tail brought a <hi>Quod ei deforceat,</hi> and counted upon an eſpecial tail, whereas in truth it was a general tail, and recovereth, and dieth; the ſaid Recovery ſhall not conclude the iſſue. See 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 18. And in our Caſe, when the Recoverors enter by force of the recovery, the ſame is a wrong to the Leſſee for years, and alſo to the Tenant for life; for the one is ejected, and the other diſſeiſed; and therefore the Re-entry of the Leſſee doth defeat all the Eſtate which was in the College under that Recovery: and here the Entry of the Leſſee for years ſhall avoid all the Eſtate which was conveyed to the College by the Recoverors. See 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 30, 31. <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingborn's Aſſiſe:</hi> Land is given to <hi>A</hi> for life, the Remainder to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder to <hi>C.</hi> in Fee: <hi>A.</hi> aliens in Fee, the Anceſtors col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral of him who hath the Fee doth releaſe to the Alienee with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty; <hi>B.</hi> enters, here the whole warranty is loſt, and all the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is recontinued: So in our Caſe, by this Entry of the Leſſee, the whole Eſtate of the College under the Recovery is defeated, ſo as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains in the College, upon which the Releaſe can enure, and then there is no warranty in the Caſe: And as the Caſe is here, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> who ſuffered the Recovery, dieth before the deſcent of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty by the death of <hi>Leonard,</hi> by whom the Releaſe with warranty was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61358:34"/>
made; by the death of which <hi>Edward</hi> the Intereſt which the College had in the ſaid Manor by the ſaid Recovery, and the Eſtoppel of it, was determined and utterly gone, and then the warranty deſcending after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cannot attach upon the poſſeſſion which was at the time of the warranty made, which was by the concluſion, which by the death of <hi>Edward</hi> is determined and removed by an Eign Title, <hi>i.</hi> the Entail. As if Tenant in tail doth diſcontinue, the Diſcontinue is diſſeiſed, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail releaſeth with warranty to the Diſſeiſor, the Diſſeiſee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth in the life of Tenant in tail, who afterwards dieth; the warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty works nothing for the cauſe aforeſaid. And alſo he put this Caſe, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail of Land grants a Rent-charge in Fee, and an Anceſtor col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral releaſeth to the Grantee with warranty, and dieth, the Tenant in tail dieth, now the iſſue is bound: but if Tenant in tail dieth before him who maketh the Releaſe, now the Rent is determined by the death of Tenant in tail, and then the warranty cannot attach upon it. At another day the Caſe was moved, and conceived in theſe words, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Tenant for life, the Remainder in tail, Tenant for life leaſeth for years, a Recovery is had againſt him in the Remainder in tail, living Tenant for life, the Recoverors enter, and ouſt the Leſſee for years, the Son and Heir of him in the Remainder in tail releaſeth with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty to him to whom the Recoverors have aſſured the Lands, the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee enters, he againſt whom the Recovery was had dieth, the Releaſor dieth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was holden, that the Entry of the Leſſee, before that the warranty had attached upon the poſſeſſion which paſſed, had avoided the warranty. And the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> conceived, That the Recovery ſhould not prejudice the iſſue in tail, but that the iſſue ſhall <hi>Fauxifie</hi> the ſame: And if Tenant in tail be diſſeiſed, and ſo diſſeiſed ſuffereth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Recovery, his iſſue ſhall not be barred, <hi>quod fuit conceſſum per om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi> And afterwards another matter was moved, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe is pleaded to be made to <hi>Lincoln</hi> College by the name of <hi>Cuſtodi ſociis &amp; Scholaribus Lincolnienſis Collegii in Oxonia,</hi> where the true name of the College, as is confeſſed by the Record in the Plea pleaded, is, <hi>Cuſtos ſive Rector, Socii &amp; Scholares Lincolnienſis Collegii in Oxonia, &amp;c.</hi> It was adjourned.

Secondly, If the Recovery be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if he in the Remainder may enter for the forfeiture.

By matter in fact, a particular Tenant may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a forfeiture, as well as by matter of Record: By matter in fact he cannot commit a forfeiture, if the Reverſion be not thereby pulled out of him in the reverſion: As if Leſſee for ten years maketh a Leaſe for 1000 years, the ſame is no forfeiture, for by that the Reverſion is not touched; but if he in matter of Record doe any thing which ſounds to the diſinheriting of him in the Reverſion, although in truth it doth not touch the inheritance, yet it is a forfeiture; which ſee 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 16. If Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life plead any thing againſt the right of him in the Reverſion, it is a forfeiture.

Tenant for life is impleaded in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> who voucheth a ſtranger, the Demandant counterpleads the vouchee, and it is found for him; he in the Reverſion hath no remedy, but a <hi>Writ</hi> of Right, and if ſuch vouchee enters into the Warranty, and loſeth by Action tried, or by default, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Book is to be intended of a Recovery executed; for there in ſuch a caſe, he in the Reverſion may not enter, but is put to his <hi>Writ</hi> of Entry by the Common Law, <hi>vide Br. Tit.</hi> Forfeit 87. 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Tenant for life is impleaded and prayes in aid of a ſtranger, he in the reverſion may enter, but if he doth not enter untill the other hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, then he cannot enter, but he is put to his <hi>Writ</hi> of Entry, <hi>Ad ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum qui praeteriit, vel de ingreſſ. ad com. Legem,</hi> and therein ſhall falſifie the Recovery. And there by <hi>Brook,</hi> Voucher of a ſtranger is not a cauſe of forfeiture; for he doth not diſaffirm the Reverſion to be in the Leſſor. And he vouched, 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 68. where Tenant for life pleaded in the Right without aid prayer; and ſo he argued, That before execution, he in the Remainder might enter, but after execution, he is put to his Action; but in our Caſe, although Execution be ſued, yet he in the Remainder may enter, for it is found by verdict, That at the time of the Recovery he was within age, and then no Laches of entry ſhall be imputed unto him, and then he ſhall not be driven to his Action: As if Tenant by the Curteſie maketh a Feoffment with Warranty, and dieth, and the ſame deſcendeth to his Heir within age, yet he ſhall enter, although that he had not avoided the Warranty in the life of his Anceſtor; And he alſo conceived that the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. did extend to this Caſe: For Sir <hi>William Pelham,</hi> the Bargainee, was but Tenant for life, and although that he be but Tenant for the life of another, yet he is Tenant for life as fully as if he were Tenant for his own life: The words of the Statute are, or otherwiſe for the term of life or lives <hi>quo ad nom.</hi> As upon the Statute of 20 <hi>E.</hi> 1. which gives receit, <hi>i. de defenſione juris;</hi> the words are, <hi>Cum quis aliquod Breve Dom. Regis impetret verſus tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem per Legem Angliae, vel feodum talliatum, vel ſub nomine Dotis, vel alio modo ad terminum vitae, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo, although that he who entreth at the time of the recovery was not next in the Remainder to the particular Eſtate, yet he is within the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for he was in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder at the time of the Recovery, and at the time of the entry, he in the immediate Remainder was dead, and then he next in Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: See 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 9. by <hi>Littleton,</hi> If I grant my ſervices to one for life, and he in a <hi>Praecipe</hi> brought againſt him, plead in the Right; or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth unto another the ſaid ſervices in Fee, the ſame is not any forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe it is not any diſcontinuance. It will be objected, That
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61358:36"/>
the words of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. are, That ſuch Recoveries ſhall be utterly void; and if ſo, then he in the Reverſion cannot be damnified, and then no cauſe of forfeiture; To that it was eaſily to be answered, That where Tenant for life doth any thing which ſounds to the diſinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him in the Reverſion by matter of Record, although it doth not deveſt or otherwiſe prejudice the Inheritance, yet it is a forfeiture. <hi>Coke</hi> contrary; Here in our Caſe there is not any Covin: Sir <hi>William Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the Bargainee, he was deceived by the Bargainor, for he did not know but that the Bargainor was ſeiſed in tail at the time of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and it was lawfull for him to doe other act in the farther aſſurance of his bargain; and it was alſo lawfull for him to vouch his Bargainor; and although the Bargainor vouched a ſtranger, yet it is not a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 16. Aid prayer of a ſtranger is a forfeiture, and the reaſon thereof is, becauſe he acknowledgeth the Reverſion to be in a ſtranger, and that is the cauſe of the forfeiture. See <hi>Book</hi> of Entries 254. Where upon aid prayer, the party to have aid ſheweth ſpecial matter; but in our Caſe, Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> hath vouched his Bargainor, and that not without cauſe, for he hath a Warranty from him; and the Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant could not counterplead it, for he had ſeiſin, by force whereof he might make a Feoffment: As unto the Caſe of 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> Receit 135. Leſſe for life in a <hi>Praecipe</hi> againſt him without aid prayer pleaded to the Enqueſt at the firſt day, in that caſe it is ſaid, that he in the Reverſion may enter. It is true, that he may enter in the Receit, but not into the Land for forfeiture, for then <hi>Fitz.</hi> would have abridged the Caſe in title of Entry Congeable, and not in the Title of Receit: and the Book of 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is good Law, for there the Tenant doth confeſs the Reverſion to be in another; but in our Caſe the Tenant voucheth, which is a lawfull act done, and according to the Covenants of his purchaſe: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Recovery be by agreement, yet it is not therefore a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for if the Tenant for life voucheth truly, it is no forfeiture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which gave Receit to the Wife, and to thoſe in the Reverſion where the particular Tenant is impleaded, and maketh default, <hi>vel reddere noluerit,</hi> there was no remedy in ſuch caſes, but by <hi>Writ</hi> of Right, but no entry, and that was for the reaſon of the credit which the Law gave to Recoveries, for if they might enter; wherefore is Receit given? but that was in two caſes onely: But afterwards, becauſe it was found, that many particular Tenants being impleaded would plead faintly, the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. gave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in ſuch caſes. And upon what reaſons were theſe Acts and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made, if in ſuch caſes the entry was congeable? But after theſe two Statutes, another practice was deviſed, for ſuch particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants would ſuffer Recoveries ſecretly, in ſuch ſort, that thoſe in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion could not have notice thereof, ſo as they could not before Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pray to be received, to remedy which miſchief, the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made, by which all Recoveries had againſt Tenant by the Curteſie, or otherwiſe for life or lives, by agreement of the parties of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lands whereof ſuch particular Tenant is ſeiſed ſhall be void, as Tenant by the Curteſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be void againſt him in the Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet there was an evaſion to creep out of that Statute; for ſuch particular Tenants, would make a Feoffment with Warranty, and then the Feoffee ſhould be impleaded in a <hi>Writ</hi> of Entry, and he vouch the Tenant for life, who would aver, and ſuch Recovery was holden to be out of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For the Recovery was not againſt ſuch particular Tenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the remedy of which miſchief, the Statute of 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was made, by which it is provided, That ſuch Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries had where ſuch particular Tenants are vouched ſhall be void, if ſuch Recovery be by Covin betwixt them: And he conceived, That the forfeiture is not in reſpect of the Recovery it ſelf, but of the Plea pleaded by the Tenant: And here in our Caſe, there is not any Covin
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61358:36"/>
found, or that Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> knew that he was but Tenant for life; but it is found, that this Recovery was with their aſſent, and that was lawfull as the caſe is; for they might agree to have ſuch a Recovery for farther aſſurance: and ſo Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> hath not vouched any but his Bargainor, and that according to their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; and this Bargainor was not a bare Tenant for life, but he had alſo a Remainder in tail, although not immediately depending upon the Eſtate for life, which he had cut off; there it was not meerly a feigned Recovery: See 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. and 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>br. Forfeit.</hi> 87. where Tenant for life being impleaded in a <hi>Praecipe,</hi> voucheth a ſtranger, the ſame is no Forfeiture, for the ſame doth not diſaffirm the Reverſion: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of Aid prayer, for a ſtranger may releaſe with warranty to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life, upon which he may vouch: And he reported in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That <hi>Bromley,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> ſent him to both the chief Iuſtices, to know their Opinions upon this point; and they were of Opinion, That the Voucher of a ſtranger was not any Forfeiture, and alſo that after the Recovery was executed, he in the Remainder could not enter; but they conceided, that the Right of him in the Remainder was not bound: And he ſaid, That after the Recovery was executed, that he in the remainder could not enter: See 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br. Forfeit</hi> 87. For if Entry in ſuch Caſes ſhould be lawfull, infinite Suits would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon, which would be much to the Diſcredit of common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, which are now the Common Aſſurances of the Land. As to the objection of the Enfancy, the ſame will not help the matter. <hi>Br. Sav. Default</hi> 50. 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A Recovery had againſt an Infant, in which he voucheth and loſeth, is not erroneous; contrary of a Recovery upon a default: And if an Infant, Tenant in tail, ſuffer a common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, the ſame is a diſcontinuance, for in ſuch Recoveries Infancy is not reſpected: And in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Iudgment had againſt the Father, the Heir ſhall not have his age: And he cited a caſe out of <hi>Bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe's Reports,</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Tenant for life, the Remainder over to a ſtranger in Fee, Tenant for life is diſſeiſed by Covin; in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> againſt the Diſſeiſor, he voucheth the Tenant for life, who enters into warranty generally, and voucheth over the common Vouchee: It was adjudged, That the Recovery was out of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the Recovery was not had againſt the particular Tenant, for he was but Tenant in Law, becauſe Vouchee; and alſo that the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was a good bar to him in the remainder, notwithſtanding that he was within age at the time of the Recovery.</p>
                  <p>And afterwards at another day the Caſe was argued by the Barons; and <hi>Clark</hi> Baron conceived, That the Entry of him in the remainder was congeable: It hath been ſaid, That Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> did not know that the Bargainor had an Eſtate but for his life, or that any other perſon had any remainder therein; the ſame is not to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to excuſe him: for 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Every Purchaſor ought at his own peril take notice of the Eſtates and charges which are upon the Lands of which he is Purchaſor; and the Law preſumes that none will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Lands without advice of Councel, and without knowing the Titles to the Lands. And although divers Statutes have been made to provide againſt the practices of particular Tenants, yet it is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no other remedy was before. And by <hi>Littleton,</hi> If Tenant for life joyneth the Miſe upon the mere right, it is a forfeiture. And he held ſtrongly, That the Iudgment did not take away the Entry, cauſe of forfeiture being given before the Iudgment: See 5 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 3. and 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 31. to that purpoſe: For where Tenant for life is impleaded, he ought to attend upon him in the reverſion, and to expect inſtructions from him in defence of his Title, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore if he maketh default, or confeſſeth Action, the ſame is a forfeiture: And as to the ſuppoſed recompence, the ſame ſhall not help this Caſe, for this is a common
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61358:37"/>
recovery, and nothing elſe but an Aſſurance: And Recoverors they are but Aſſignees, and they ſhall take advantage of Conditions by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and a Recoveror ſhall be ſeiſed to the uſe of him who ſuffereth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, if no other uſe be expreſſed. And he alſo held, That when Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life bargains, and ſells his Lands by Deed enrolled, although no Fee paſſeth, yet it is a forfeiture, and that by reaſon of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolment, which is matter of Record. And he ſaid that if an Infant, Tenant for life, be diſſeiſed, and the Diſſeiſor dieth, and afterwards the Infant dieth, that he in the Remainder might enter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gent,</hi> Baron, argued to the ſame intent; and he ſaid, That if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life ſuffereth a Recovery, the ſame is not ſimply a forfeiture, for he may have a warranty upon a Releaſe or Confirmation made to him. Attornment doth not give a Right, but is onely a Conſent, yet if he who hath not any thing in the Reverſion will levy a Fine thereof unto another, and afterwards the Conuſee brings a <hi>Quod juris clamat</hi> againſt the Tenant of the Land, and he attorn, it is a Forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manwood,</hi> Baron, to the ſame intent; this is a new Caſe, and I have not ſeen nor read the Caſe in any Book, nor ſeen any preſidents; and it is a great caſe, and a general caſe, and worthy to be argued: And I conceive clearly, That here is a direct and expreſs forfeiture: the Dignity of Iudgments in reputation of Law hath been urged, which ought to ſtand in force until they be reverſed by <hi>Error</hi> or <hi>Attaint:</hi> And alſo <hi>Littleton</hi> 481. hath been urged, where upon the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 3. he ſaith, That before the Statute aforeſaid, if a Leaſe had been made to one for life, the remainder to a ſtranger, and afterwards a ſtranger by faint Action hath recovered againſt Tenant for life by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, and afterwards the Tenant for life died, he in the Remainder had not any remedy: But there <hi>Littleton</hi> doth not report the ſame as his own Opinion, but as an Opinion conceived by a Reader upon the ſaid Statute; and in truth it is but a meer conceit. And as to the main point, he took this difference; Such Recoveries in which the title of the Demandant ſtands indifferent to the Court, and <hi>non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat,</hi> if it be good, or not being ſuffered by Tenant for life by default or confeſſion, without aid-prayer of him in the Reverſion, do not make any forfeiture, although that the Tenant for life hath not dealt with him in the Reverſion, not having prayed in aid of him: And in ſuch caſe, if a Leaſe be made for life, the Remainder over in Fee, upon ſuch Recovery he in the remainder ſhall have a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or a <hi>Writ</hi> of Right, and ſhall not put out him who recovered, without any Action, and that by the common Law. Then came the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. which gave unto the Wife a <hi>Gui in vita,</hi> upon a Recovery had againſt the Husband by default, where before ſhe had not any remedy, but onely <hi>Writ</hi> of Right: and notwithſtanding, <hi>ſi ulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius quaeratur, ſi neceſſe habet oſtendere jus ſuum, ſecundum formam brevis quod prius impetraverat:</hi> And if his Right be not better than the right of him in the Reverſion, he ſhall loſe it, notwithſtanding the Iudgment given before for him: and that Statute gave Receipt, or <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Entry, ad terminum qui praeteriit;</hi> and that Statute is to be intended of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries where a good Title or indifferent is, ſo as <hi>non Conſtat Curiae,</hi> if it be good, or not? After that Tenant for life was driven unto a new ſhift, and would not make default, or loſe for not pleading, but he would plead, but that faintly; for the remedy of which miſchief, the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. which gave Receipt in ſuch caſe; the particular Tenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrained by this Statute, he jugled yet, and practiſed to ſuffer a Recovery ſecretly, without notice of him in the Reverſion: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying of which miſchief, the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made, and that makes ſuch Recovery had againſt ſuch a particular Tenant void againſt him the Reverſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61358:37"/>It hath been objected, That the ſaid Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. did not give any forfeiture in this caſe, but makes the Recovery void; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he in the Reverſion ought to ſtay until after the death of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Tenant: To that I ſhall ſpeak after. But here our caſe is of a common Recovery, and it doth appear to the Court, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant hath not right, for the Tenant might have barred him: Alſo this Recovery is not to the uſe of the Recoveror, but to the uſe of him who was Tenant in it; and in truth it is nothing elſe but an aſſurance: and in theſe feigned Recoveries the Recoveror comes in under the Title of the Tenant to it, and not paramount, as in caſe of a Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon a good Title. A Leaſe for years made by him who after ſuffers a Recovery is good, and ſhall not be defeated by the Recovery; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is where the Recovery is upon a good Title. See Statute of <hi>Gloceſt. cap.</hi> 11. where upon default of the Tenant, Receipt is given for Leſſee for years; yet if the Tenant vouch, upon default of the Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee the Leſſee for years ſhall be received: and now Receipt of Leſſee for years is out of the Book, for by the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. he may falſifie the Recovery: but no Receipt lieth in the caſe of a common Recovery, for that he who recovers cannot put out the Termor. As to that which my Brother <hi>Clark</hi> hath ſaid, That the bargain and ſale in this caſe is not any forfeiture, but when the bargain and ſale is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, then it is a forfeiture; I am not of ſuch Opinion: for although that the Enrolment be of Record, yet the Deed is not of Record; for againſt a Deed enrolled, a man may plead Infancy, although none can plead <hi>Non eſt factum.</hi> Alſo he held, That although by the bargain and ſale, and the Enrolment of it, the Bargainee had not a fee, for by ſuch act the Reverſion is not removed; yet by the Recovery, and the Execution of it, the Bargainee hath gained a fee out of the Leſſor, for the Recovery is to the uſe of the Bargainee, againſt whom it was had. It hath been objected, that here is onely a Voucher, which paradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was lawfull in this caſe, by reaſon of a warranty paramount, or of a Releaſe or Confirmation with warranty: and two Caſes have been vouched to that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. Tenant for life being impleaded in a <hi>Praecipe,</hi> voucheth a ſtranger, the Demandant counterpleads the Voucher, which is found for him, he in the Reverſion hath no remedy but a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Right;</hi> ſo if the Vouchee had entred into the warranty, and loſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to that book, we ought not to conceive, That every Caſe reported in our books is Law; but let us obſerve, of what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that caſe is; truly it is the conceit of the Reporter himſelf, for he puts the Caſe, and reſolves the caſe, but no Iudge or Serjeant is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other caſe is 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>b.</hi> Note by <hi>Heydon</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If my Tenant for life voucheth a ſtranger, who entreth into the warranty generally, and doth not know how to bar the Demandant, the Tenant ſhall recover in value, and the Reverſion of that which he hath in value ſhall be in me in lieu of my former Reverſion; as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to the Tenant for term of life ſhall enure to him in the Reverſion: But that is but the Opinion of one Serjeant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I anſwer to theſe books, If the demandant in ſuch recovery hath a good Title, ſo as the Tenant or the Vouchee, as <hi>Heydon</hi> ſaith, do not know how to bar the Demandant, there ſuch Voucher of a ſtranger is no forfeiture, nor ſuch Recovery ſuffered upon it, for againſt his Will, <hi>volens nolens,</hi> he ſuffered it: but if the Tenant hath good matter to bar the Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and no good cauſe of Voucher, nor any warranty, as the matter is in the caſe of a common Recovery, there the Voucher of a ſtranger, or ſuffering of a Recovery, is a forfeiture of his Eſtate. And here in our caſe if the Demandant hath not any Title, the Tenant or Vouchee hath not any warranty; but the Tenant might have barred the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant if he would: And he ſaid, That the Voucher onely doth not make the forfeiture, but rather the recovery; for when Iudgment
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61358:38"/>
is given, and Execution is had, then the Fee is plucked out of the Reverſioner: <hi>vide</hi> 6 <hi>R.</hi> 2. If Tenant for life claimeth a Fee, the ſame is a forfeiture: but here Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> hath done more, for he hath gained Fee by the Iudgment, therefore <hi>à fortiori</hi> it ſhall be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture. But let us ſee a little what meddlings or attempts by the particular Tenants are cauſes of forfeiture, and what not: 5 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 3. <hi>A.</hi> brought a <hi>Writ of Entry</hi> againſt Tenant for life by Colluſion to ouſt <hi>B.</hi> of his Reverſion, ſuppoſing that the Tenant for life held of his Leaſe; the Tenant confeſſed the Action, upon which Iudgment is given; <hi>B.</hi> enters, and his Entry adjudged lawfull, for this Recovery is adjudged in Law but an alienation to the diſinheritance of him in the Reverſion: and there it appeareth, that ſuch Recovery by Covin is but an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without any ſtrength of a Recovery. And he cited many other caſes cited before by <hi>Altham:</hi> 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Recept</hi> 135. where Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life pleads in chief, and prays in aid of a ſtranger, where he might bar the Demandant, and would not, the ſame is a forfeiture: Alſo 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 2. and 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where Tenant for life, in a <hi>Quid juris clamat,</hi> attorned to the Conuſee upon a Fine levyed by him that had not any thing in the Land, the ſame was a forfeiture; and yet the Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not deveſt the Reverſion out of the Leſſor: 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 7. and 8. Land was given by Fine in tail, the Remainder over to a ſtranger in fee, the Donee took a Wife and died without iſſue, the Wife accepted Dower aſſigned by a ſtranger, he in the remainder brought a <hi>Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> againſt the Wife; ſhe is Tenant in Dower of the aſſignment of a ſtranger, and pleads to the Title; the Demandant recovereth, ſhe hath loſt her Dower, for ſhe hath not pleaded as ſhe ought, being a particular Tenant, <hi>&amp;c. H.</hi> 4. Tenant for life loſeth his Land in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery againſt him againſt his Will, and thereupon brings <hi>Quod ei de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceat,</hi> and declares upon an Eſtate-tail, and recovers, the ſame is a forfeiture, becauſe he hath challenged a higher Eſtate than he had. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. Tenant for life joyns the Miſe upon the meer right: 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Leſſee for years being ouſted, brings an Aſſiſe, and recovers: 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Accepts a Fine of a ſtranger upon condition <hi>come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> all theſe are forfeitures. In the principal Caſe here, the Tenant who ſuffers his Recovery doth not plead at all to defend the Right: but whereas he might have barred the Demandant, he giveth ſtrength to his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Title, and makes it a perfect Title; and by ſuffering this Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Iudgment to paſs upon it, he hath taken the Reverſion out of the Leſſor to whom he owed Fealty, and therefore he ſhall forfeit his Eſtate. And without any doubt it is apparent to the Court, that the Demandant in this Recovery hath not any Title, but the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in ſuch caſes are but as Aſſignees or Purchaſors, which appears by the Statute of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>ca.</hi> 2. which gives Diſtreſs and Avowry to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the inventing of Recoveries, it was a neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for it was to take away Eſtate-tails, which were the cauſes of great miſchiefs and inconveniencies in this Realm: and there was great reaſon for it; for Tenant in tail might by the common Law alien his Lands <hi>poſt prolem ſuſcitatam,</hi> and now he hath an Inheritance, and may do Waſte, But he was ſo reſtrained by the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. that all the Realm, and the Subjects in it, were inveigled thereby; Ioyntures of Wives, Leaſes of Fermors, Mortgages to Creditors, Statutes, and other Aſſurances, were defeated by the deaths of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in tail, which was both againſt the common Law, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Conſcience. Theſe matters coming to the knowledge of the Iuſtices, and the miſchiefs thereupon following being very frequent, and it appearing that the Tenant in tail was a dangerous fellow, and that there was no ſafe dealing with him, they took conſideration of them: and conſidering alſo with themſelves, That Lineal Warranty and Aſſets, and Collateral Warranty without Aſſets, did bar the

                  <p>THE Caſe was this, That one <hi>Bonham</hi> was ſeiſed of a Manor, within which there were divers Cuſtomary Lands demiſable by Copy for three lives: The Lord of the Manor did demiſe ſome of thoſe Lands to three Siſters, <hi>Habendum</hi> to them for their lives <hi>ſucceſſive,</hi> for the Fine of 100<hi>l.</hi> by them paid; and they being ſeiſed accordingly, the eldeſt Siſter, who was Tenant in poſſeſſion, took to Husband one <hi>Chapman;</hi> after which the ſaid Lord by Indenture leaſed the ſame Land to the eldeſt Siſter, the Remainder to the Husband, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the ſecond Siſter, and no Agreement was made thereunto by the ſecond Siſter by Deed, before or after the making of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture; but four days after the Leaſe made ſhe agreed to it in the Country, and then took to Husband <hi>Curtiſe,</hi> and they entred, clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſaid Land, upon which Entry the Action was brought: The point was, That when the Leaſe by Indenture was made to the eldeſt Siſter, at which time no agreement was made by the ſecond Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who was in Remainder; yet when after ſhe agreed, If by that Agreement her Right to the Copihold were extinct, or not? ſo as the intereſt of the eldeſt Siſter being gone by the acceptance of the Eſtate by the Indenture, the ſecond Siſter might come and claim her cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary intereſt, as it were paramount the intereſt of the eldeſt Siſter, which ſhe claimed by the Indenture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Glanvil,</hi> The cuſtomary intereſt of the eldeſt Siſter is extinct upon this matter, by reaſon of her agreement to it afterwards. Where an Eſtate is given to one by a lawfull act, it ſhall be adjudged in the party before agreement, until it be diſagreed unto; and if the party do once agree, he cannot afterwards diſagree unto it. If an Eſtate be lawfully made to a Copyholder but for years, his whole intereſt in the Copyhold is determined: and that a Freehold cannot be waived in <hi>pais,</hi> but onely
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61358:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by matter of Record: See 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Joynt-tenants</hi> 13. A Charter of Feoffment was made to four, and Seiſin was delivered to three of them in the name of them all; and afterwards the fourth Feoffee came and ſaw the Deed, and ſaid, That ſhe would not have any thing in the Lands, but altogether diſagree unto it; and it was, that that diſagreement by word in <hi>pais</hi> did not deveſt the Freehold out of her: But when the party doth diſagree in a Court of Record, there the Freehold is out of the party <hi>ab initio;</hi> and if he once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he ſhall not diſagree afterwards. See <hi>Littl. Sect.</hi> 648. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail enfeoffeth his Son and Heir apparent, and another, and Livery and Seiſin is made to the other, according to the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Feoffment, in the name of the Son alſo, the Son not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, nor diſagreeing to the Feoffment; the other Feoffee dieth, the Son neither occupies the Lands nor takes the profits of them during the life of his Father; the Father dieth, the ſame is a Remitter to the Son, becauſe the Freehold is caſt upon him, and there is no default in him, and therefore he is remitted: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an illegal act is otherwiſe; for if <hi>A.</hi> diſſeiſe <hi>B.</hi> to the uſe of <hi>C.</hi> in ſuch caſe nothing is in <hi>C.</hi> before an expreſs Agreement, for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin was an unlawfull act. And in this Caſe at Bar, it doth not appear that the eldeſt Siſter is dead, and therefore the Right of the ſecond Siſter cannot now come in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shute,</hi> Iuſtice, If the ſecond Siſter, at the time of the making of the ſaid Indenture, had agreed unto it, then it had been a full extiguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by an agreement afterwards it is not good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Iuſtice, The remainder is in conſideration of the Law; and the Eſtate of the firſt Siſter is not ſo determined, that any can take advantage of it; for the Lord, againſt this Leaſe by Deed indented, cannot enter, or claim any thing: and the ſecond Siſter, although ſhe hath not agreed, yet ſhe cannot enter during the life of her elder Siſter, for her Remainder takes effect in poſſeſſion after the death of her ſaid Siſter. But if any ſhould take advantage of it, it ſhould be the Lord, if his Deed indented did not ſtand againſt him. And afterwards Iudgment was given againſt the younger Siſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clench,</hi> Iuſtice, was of another Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Entry of the younger Siſter, notwithſtanding that her elder Siſter was alive, was lawfull: <hi>Quaere</hi> of that.</p>

It was moved in <hi>Arreſt</hi> of Iudgment, becauſe, that the Defendant had entitled himſelf to a Leet, by an Eſtate in the Hundred, and did not ſhew a Deed of it, which was ſaid, he ought to have done; as is 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 48. And of ſuch opinion was <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Windham,</hi> Iuſtices. <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Rhodes</hi> Iuſtices, contrary, as this caſe is, and that the Avowant need not ſhew a Deed, But if the hundred it ſelf had been in queſtion, then a Deed ought to have been ſhewed; But here the Avowant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles himſelf to one thing, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> a Leet, and a Leet Fee, by reaſon of the Hundred, and it is ſufficient for him to ſay, That he is ſeiſed of the Hundred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although it be by diſſeiſin: for if he hath poſſeſſion of the Hundred, be it <hi>jure, vel injuria,</hi> he ſhall have alſo all things incident thereunto, for the poſſeſſion of the Hundred draws to him the Leet, and the Leet, the Leet Fee. But admit in this caſe a Deed ought to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">1 Cro. 217. 245.</note> we are to ſee if the ſame be helped by the Statute of <hi>Jeofailes,</hi> which extends to defaults in form in <hi>Writs,</hi> Original or Iudicial Counts, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Plaints, Bills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 18 <hi>Eliz. cap</hi> 14. and ſuch defects are thereby helped.

But <hi>Windham</hi> and <hi>Periam</hi> were of a contrary opinion; For Avowry is in lieu of a Declaration, and the Plea of the Plaintiff to the Avowry, is not called a <hi>Replication,</hi> but a bar to the Avowry. But admit the Avowry be within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, then if the Statute of <hi>Jeofailes</hi> there extend to help it? And <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> conceived that it did: But the Plaintiff might have demurred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Avowry for the not ſhewing the Deed, and Iudgment ſhould have been given for him; but when he hath traverſed, and the iſſue found againſt him, now it ſhall be intended, that Avowant hath a Deed, although he hath not ſhewed the ſame. Another Exception was taken, becauſe it is ſaid in the Avowry, That the ſaid Leet was holden, 5 <hi>Julii,</hi> and then it was void: For the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 35 requires, that Leets be holden within one Month after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and <hi>Eaſter;</hi> But that Exception was not allowed: For by <hi>Anderſon, Windham</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> by force of the Preſcription, The Lord might hold his Leet what day he pleaſed, and that his Liberty is not reſtrained by the Statute; and ſuch is the common experience: for the ſame Statute provides for it, <hi>(ſcil.) Quod quilibet habeat libertates ſuas quas habuit, &amp; habere conſuevit tempore Regis H. avi noſtri, vel quas poſtea perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiret:</hi> And by <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the ſaid Statute doth not extend but to the Sheriffs Towns, and not to other Leets, which ſee <hi>Br.</hi> Leets, 23.

upon the Caſe of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. which was affirmed by him to be good Law; Contrary by <hi>Periam,</hi> but he granted, that if a Leet hath uſed to be holden at one day certain, other than that which is limited by the ſaid Statute, the ſame may ſo continue, notwithſtanding the Statute, for ſuch Liberty is ſaved by the Statute. And by <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Rhodes;</hi> If the King grant to one a Leet to hold <hi>Semel quolibet anno,</hi> and doth not ſay, <hi>Ad libitum</hi> of the Grantee, yet the Grant is good, and the Grantee may hold it at what day he will.</p>

Here in the Declaration are two things, Firſt, the Conſpiracy, Secondly, the execution of it,, for the one without the other will not maintain the Action, but here the Conſpiracy is not purſued, nor executed according to that which is laid to be conſpired. The Conſpiracy is laid, That the Factor upon his account deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 4000 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Barbary</hi> money, <hi>per nomen bona &amp; denariorum ſummas,</hi> and the Execution is laid, That he demanded in allowance of wares delivered to <hi>Iſaac Abeſs:</hi> And he took a general rule, That a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ſhall never be charged, but where his Commandment is ſtrictly and preciſely purſued. <hi>Barbary</hi> money is included in this word <hi>Bona,</hi> for it is not current in <hi>England:</hi> See as to the purſuing of the Commandment; <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Archer</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Plow.</hi> 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 437. And in our Caſe, he not onely puts the thing, but alſo the perſon, for the Conſpiracy is that he demanded allowance for goods delivered to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and his four ſons, for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> In the one Caſe it is pretended, That <hi>Iſaac</hi> and four ſons are Debtors; and in the other Caſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> onely: Alſo here <hi>Dawbeny</hi> hath allowed and accepted the accompt of the Factors, againſt which he cannot have this Action; for it is

                     <hi>ignorantia craſſa, idque facti, quae non excuſat:</hi> Alſo upon ſuch incertain demand as is laid in the Declaration, <hi>Dawbeny</hi> was not holden to make allowance: <hi>i.</hi> for ſo much wares upon a certain bargain made with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac;</hi> and that was not a lawfull demand, and upon ſuch uncertain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he was not bound to make allowance; <hi>Et hoc modo eſt ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia juris quae non excuſat omnino.</hi> Alſo here <hi>Swinnerton</hi> onely accompts and demands allowances, and <hi>Swinnerton</hi> onely was not Factor, but alſo <hi>Tedcaſtel,</hi> and therefore <hi>Dawbeny</hi> was not bounden to allow that accompt to <hi>Swinnerton,</hi> no more than to a mere ſtranger: And alſo <hi>Dawbeny</hi> alone was not to make allowance, for the two Factors were accomptable to him, and to <hi>Goores</hi> alſo. And ſo allowance by one of them to whom they are accomptable, is not good. One Executor (where the power is committed to two) ſells the Land, the ſale is void, and two joint Attorneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one onely can doe nothing: And here in this Declaration, it is many times alledged, that they were <hi>conjunctim Mercatores, conjunctim Factores;</hi> But I confeſs, that one joint Factor, with the expreſs conſent of his companion, may accompt alone; and ſo of the other, one may by expreſs conſent take an Accompt onely. One Factor is no Factor where there are many joint Factors; and in our Caſe, the two <hi>Goores</hi> and <hi>Dawbeny</hi> ſaw the accompt, but <hi>Dawbeny</hi> onely allowed of it, and that is not good: As if two Arbitrators are, and one onely makes the award, although both hear the matter. 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz.

That the one Accomptant cannot accompt without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; but there <hi>Parn</hi> ſaith, That it had been adjudged, 6 <hi>E.</hi> 3. that the one might accompt without the other: See 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s Caſe. <hi>Tanfield</hi> contrary: As to the firſt Error, it is but convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and matter of inducement to the fraud and conſpiracy, which is the principal point of the Action; and therefore needeth not to be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely alledged: and alſo by the general iſſue, they have paſſed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, and all the ſpecial matter of the Count is contained in the general iſſue; for <hi>not guilty,</hi> goes to all, and includes the whole. Alſo upon the matter, the Iury hath found that they were joint Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; and although they were joint Factors, and the one onely hath accompted, yet the ſame accompt is good enough, for it was made with the conſent of the other, as appeareth by the Declaration. <hi>Conſpirave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, &amp; agreaverunt,</hi> that <hi>Swinnerton</hi> in his accompt, <hi>peteret</hi> allowance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo there was conſent to take the accompt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 6 <hi>E.</hi> 3. it is adjudged <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> And that the one joint Factor may accompt without his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is the Law of Merchants; for Factors are oftentimes diſperſed, ſo as they cannot be both preſent at their accompts, and ſo it hath been heretofore allowed in the <hi>King's-Bench:</hi> And as to that that <hi>Dawbeny</hi> onely hath given allowance to this accompt, the ſame is good enough: If I promiſe to two to doe any act, the one of them may diſcharge me from it, and that by word, for it is but a perſonal thing: Two joint-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of a Manor grant the Stewardſhip thereof to one, and 20 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> for the exerciſe of it; if the one diſcharge him, it is a good diſcharge as to the ſervice, but yet he ſhall have his Fee: If the Lord of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor grant the Stewardſhip thereof to another, taking 10 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> of the iſſues and profits of his Court there for his Fee: and afterwards the Lord diſchargeth the Steward, the ſame is void; for it is a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Steward, for he cannot have his Fee, if no Courts be holden; but if the Fee be limited to iſſue out of Lands, there ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge is good; for there the Steward ſhall have his Fee although that no Courts be holden there, See 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. to that purpoſe. <hi>Egerton,</hi> Solicitor, to the contrary; although (as hath been objected) the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joint Merchant be but matter of inducement, it is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding material, and without it the Action will not lie: In Debt, upon Arbitrament, The Plaintiff in his Declaration, ought to ſhew the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and although the Defendant pleadeth, <hi>Nihil debet,</hi> yet if the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61358:43"/>
place of the ſubmiſſion be not ſhewed in the Declaration, all is naught; for although that it be but inducement, yet it is a material inducement; for if no ſubmiſion, no award, and if no award, no Debt, and then no cauſe of Action. The Caſe of 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. cited before, there the Accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants by their Deed, or jointly, or ſeverally accomptable at the pleaſure of him to whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo, becauſe it is ſet forth in the Declaration, that they were joint Merchants of wares, adventured into <hi>Barbary,</hi> for the ſpace of two years; the Factor in praying of allowance, ought to ſhew what wares were adventured into <hi>Barbary</hi> within the ſaid two years. Conſpiracy is a thing odious, and ought to be directly proved; and it is not reaſon, that that which he himſelf hath once allowed, he himſelf ſhall after defeat it, as here he attempts. And he relied much upon the variance between the Conſpiracy and the execution of it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before by <hi>Coke,</hi> where by the Conſpiracy, <hi>Iſaac</hi> is made the Debtor, with his four ſons; and in the Execution, <hi>Iſaac</hi> is made the onely Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and to that point, he vouched the Caſe, 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Ph. &amp; Ma.</hi> betwixt <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Nevil,</hi> That an award was to be performed,<note place="margin">Brown and Nevil's Caſe.</note>

In all perſonal things, where two are chargeable to two, the one may ſatisfie it, and one may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſatisfaction, and bind his companion, and yet the one cannot have an Action without his companion, nor both onely againſt one, 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 3. Two joint tenants of a Manor have one Bailiff of it, the one of them aſſigns Auditors to the Bailiff, who accompts, and is found in arrearages, the ſame is a good accompt, and it is holden there, that both, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may have Debt upon the arrearages of the accompt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the manner. And if one may aſſign Auditors, he may alſo take accompt, and diſcharge the accomptant againſt his companion. And he conceived, That this allowance of the accompt by <hi>Dawbeny,</hi> did not exclude him of his Actions, but rather gave him cauſe of Action, <hi>Nam Laeſus non eſſet, niſi credidiſſet;</hi> and the Bailiff of my Husbandry, who bargains and ſells for me, if upon his accompt to me, he alledgeth and ſurmiſeth, that he hath ſold my Cattel to one who is decayed, and upon that ſurmiſe I allow his accompt; afterwards, <hi>Re comperta,</hi> I ſhall have an Action of Deceit: And in this very Caſe at the Bar, it was holden in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> That <hi>Dawbeny,</hi> notwithſtanding his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this falſe accompt, ſhould have his Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Note that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>viz.

One was bounden, that he ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien certain Lands, and the Obligor did thereof enfeoff his ſon and heir apparent, the ſame was held, to be no alienation within the Condition of the Obligation: Of the other ſide it was argued, The remainder doth

not veſt preſently; for it is incertain, if it ſhall veſt at all; for if <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> dieth before he cometh to the age of 22 years, it was conceived by him, that the Remainder ſhall never veſt, for the words of the Will are, <hi>Then the Lands ſhall remain, &amp;c.</hi> 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3.

And it was ſaid, that this Leaſe is a Covenous Leaſe, being made for 240 years, without any Rent reſerved: As ſuch a Leaſe made for 100 years, or 200 years, is <hi>Mortmain,</hi> as well as if it had been an expreſs Feoffment, or <hi>Alienation.</hi> But it was ſaid by ſome,<note place="margin">Antea 36, 37.</note> that here is not any ſale at all, nor any leaſe; for the Leſſor himſelf hath not any thing in the Land demiſed: As if a man diſſeiſeth a Feme ſole, and ſeaſeth the Lands, and afterwards marrieth the diſſeiſee, he ſhall avoid his own Leaſe, 5 <hi>E</hi> 3. One was bound that he ſhould not alien ſuch a Manor, the Obligor alieneth one Acre, parcell of it, the Obligation is forfeit, See 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br.</hi> Mortgage 36. <hi>A.</hi> leaſeth to a religious houſe for 100 years, and ſo from 100 years to 100 years, untill 800 years be encurred, the ſame is <hi>Mortmain, Vide</hi> Stat. 7 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>Colore termini eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, vel vendere.</hi> And in the principal Caſe, if the Deviſee had entred into a Statute to the value of the Land leaſed, by the intent of the Will, the ſame had been a ſale; and ſuch was the opinion of the whole Court: and by the Court, the word <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> ſhall not be referred to the words precedent, but unto the words following; <hi>(ſcil.) in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum perdat</hi> the Lands. And if a cuſtome be in the caſe that the Infant of the age of 15 years may ſell his Lands; if he make a Leaſe, the ſame is not warranted by the cuſtome: And afterwards it was adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the whole Court, that the Leaſe made as before, was a ſale within the intent of the Will of the Deviſor.</p>

                     <hi>CLement Paſton</hi> was Defendant in an Action of Debt brought againſt him by <hi>George Ognel,</hi> upon an Eſcape, and the Caſe was this: <hi>Francis Woodhouſe</hi> was bound in a Recognizance to the ſaid <hi>Ognel;</hi> Whereupon <hi>Ognel</hi> ſued forth a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and upon two <hi>Nihils</hi> retorned, had Iudgment, and upon that a <hi>Levari facias,</hi> and then a <hi>Capias ad ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faciendum,</hi> upon which <hi>Paſton</hi> the Defendant, a Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to whom the <hi>Capias</hi> was directed, took the party, and afterwards ſuffered him to eſcape. The Defendant pleaded, That before the ſaid <hi>Capias,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Francis Woodhouſe</hi> was committed to him, and in his ward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for Felony; and after the <hi>Capias,</hi> was endicted thereof, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and found guilty, after which he eſcaped; And all this was found by ſpecial verdict: Firſt it was argued, if upon a Recognizance acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the <hi>Chancery</hi> an Action lieth; and it was ſaid by <hi>Bois,</hi> That it doth not lie in the mouth of the Sheriff to ſay, that this <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie in the Caſe: As if a Iuſtice of Peace maketh a Warrant to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, which Warrant is not good in Law, yet the Conſtable is not to examine that, or to diſpute the validity of it, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And a <hi>Capias</hi> hath lain in ſuch caſe, and ſo it hath been the courſe for the ſpace of 200 years: and he ſaid, That although <hi>Francis Woodhouſe</hi> was convict of Felony, yet the ſame is not any diſcharge of the execution, as 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 8. although the husband be attainted of Felony, yet he is not ſo dead in Law, but if the King pardon him afterwards, he ſhall be reſtored, and his wife ſhall have <hi>Dower;</hi> and if he be killed, his wife ſhall have an Appeal: 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4. My Villain is attainted, the ſame is no diſcharge of his villainage as to me; But if the King pardon him after, he ſhall be my Villain, 6 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4. One is in Execution <hi>pro fine Regis,</hi> and afterwards is outlawed for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and hath his Charter of pardon for the Felony yet he remains in Execution for the intereſt of the party, for there the Execution is not extinct, but onely ſuſpended. <hi>Godfrey</hi> contrary, <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie upon a Recognizance; but if Debt be brought upon a Recognizance, and the Plaintiff recovereth, then a <hi>Capias</hi> lieth; which ſee 14 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 306. <hi>Puttenham</hi>'s Caſe. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 6. In <hi>Dower</hi> the Demandant recovereth her <hi>Dower,</hi> and damages, and prayeth a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> for the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but ſhe could not have it; for no <hi>Capias</hi> lieth upon the original; and to the ſame purpoſe, ſee 8 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Fitz. Execution,</hi> 164. 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as pro fine</hi> lieth for the King, where no <hi>Capias</hi> lieth in the Original; but no <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> for the party; no <hi>Capias</hi> in Debt before the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and ſee the Stat. of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>cum debitum fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit recognit. ſi in electione ſequent. execut. habere per Fiere facias,</hi> or <hi>Elegit,</hi> therefore no other manner of Execution; for the Statute hath provided <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> And he ſaid, That debt doth not lie upon a Statute Merchant, or Staple: See 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. Another reaſon why a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie in ſuch caſe, is upon the words of the Recognizance, <hi>Et niſi fecerit, tunc concedit, quod ſumma praedict. levetur de bonis &amp; catallis, terris &amp; tenemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis; Ergo,</hi> not of the body. And when <hi>Woodhouſe</hi> was convict of Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Queen had an intereſt in his body, and upon the pardon, the Execution which was ſuſpended during the conviction, is now recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And he confeſſed the caſe of Villainage; that during the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Lord cannot meddle with the Villain in the preſence of the King, See 27 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 49. and ſee 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 65. <hi>A.</hi> was condemned to <hi>B.</hi> in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain damages upon an Action of Treſpaſs brought by <hi>B.</hi> againſt <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> in Execution upon a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end.</hi> and afterwards was arraigned of Felony, and thereof attainted,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61358:47"/>
and committed to the Ordinary, as <hi>Clark, Attaint.</hi> And the Iuſtices commanded the Ordinary, That after that the priſoner had made his purgation, that he ſhould not let him go at large, but ſhould conduct him to the priſon of <hi>Newgate</hi> again: And there is a <hi>Quaere</hi> made by the Reporter, If after purgation the Ordinary might ſuffer him to eſcape; and if he at whoſe ſuit he was condemned in Treſpaſs ſhall have debt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ordinary for ſuch eſcape. At another day the matter was argued by <hi>Coke</hi> for the Plaintiff, at the Common Law, <hi>No Land was ſubject to Execution, i.</hi> no Lands of the Debtor himſelf; but yet the Lands of the Debtor being deſcended to his heir, ſhould be chargeable to the Obligee of the Debtor, in which he and his heirs were bound, and that ſeemed to be very ſtrange; and he conceived, That in that point, cuſtome and uſage had encroached upon the Common Law: The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13. gave <hi>Elegit</hi> of the moyety of the Lands; but yet there was no <hi>Capias</hi> in Debt before, 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. before which Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, it was a general Rule, That no <hi>Capias</hi> lay at the Common Law, but where the King was to have a Fine, See 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6.6. At the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law <hi>Capias</hi> did not lie but where the Action is <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> or that the King is to have a Fine; For there was Outlawry at the Common Law in ſuch caſe. It will be objected, That the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. which gave <hi>Capias</hi> in Debt, doth not extend to a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; That ſuch Proceſs ſhall be made in a <hi>Writ</hi> of Debt, as is uſed in a <hi>Writ</hi> of Accompt; and here is no <hi>Writ</hi> of Debt, but a <hi>Scire facias</hi> onely: If my Debtor upon an Obligation cometh without a <hi>Writ,</hi> and confeſſeth the Debt, I ſhall have a <hi>Capias</hi> againſt him, and yet the ſame is not in a <hi>Writ</hi> of Debt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo in caſe of Recognizance. Where a Statute ſpeaks preciſely of a <hi>Writ</hi> Original; yet oftentimes by Equity it ſhall extend to a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and other judicial Proceſs: As upon the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. which enables the Incumbent to plead in a <hi>Quare Impedit.</hi> It ſhall extend to a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. And in our caſe a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie by the Letter, yet it lieth by Equity. And he ſaid, That Statute which helps the Subjects to get their debts and rights, are to be, and have been taken beneficially and liberally expounded, in advantage of the Creditors. And ſee 48 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 14. Where a <hi>Scire facias</hi> is ſued upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance, a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie, but there it is holden, that in a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> upon a Recovery in debt, a <hi>Capias</hi> lieth. And as to this <hi>Capias,</hi> the Sheriff is but the miniſter to the Court, and he is not to controll the Court, but to accept of the ſame, as the ſame is directed to him. It is a common learning in our Law, That although the Court doth proceed <hi>inverſo ordine,</hi> yet it ſhall not be utterly void, 36 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 34. Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given at the Common Law of Lands within the five Ports; for the five Ports in times paſt, were parcel of the Crown: But of Lands in <hi>Wales</hi> it was otherwiſe before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which <hi>Wales</hi> is united to the Crown. And although that the <hi>Capias erronice Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi> the ſame is but erroneous, and ſo voidable, and not void, for Error may be as well aſſigned in the <hi>Executione judicii,</hi> as <hi>in redditione judicii,</hi> 16 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. Outlawry without an Original <hi>Writ,</hi> is not void, but voidable, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and the reaſon thereof is given, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in <hi>Collins</hi>'s Caſe, but they are Iudges of the cauſe, although that their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings be not according to Law. But the Sheriff, or any other ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhall not take advantage thereof, See 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. and he cited to this purpoſe, 13 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Barre 253. The Iailor ſhall not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of undue proceedings of the Auditors againſt an Accomptant; and he inſiſted much upon the Vſage and Precedents, and cuſtoms of Courts which are Laws in ſuch caſes. And although that by ſtrict and preciſe rule of Law, a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie naturally nor properly upon a Recognizance, where the ſuit begins by <hi>Scire facias,</hi> yet becauſe the uſual practice, and common experience hath allowed of it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61358:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereof from time to time: It is ſafer to ſuffer a miſchief to one, than an inconvenience to many. And although the Proverb, <hi>Exempla illuſtrant, non docent aut probant,</hi> may hold place in ſome arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yet in our Law, Examples are good arguments, 11 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 3. In the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> a man <hi>in cuſtodia Mariſchalli,</hi> ſhall be put to answer a Bill, but in the <hi>Common-Bench,</hi> a man who is in the cuſtody of the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> ſhall not be put to answer to a Bill, and that is by reaſon of the ſeveral uſages and cuſtoms in the ſaid ſeveral Courts; ſo as cuſtome and uſage makes a Law in ſuch caſe. 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 30. in a <hi>Writ</hi> of Meſne, The Iudges were clear of opinion, That the Plaintiff ought not onely to ſhew the Tenure betwixt him and the Tenant Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravail, but alſo betwixt the Meſne and the Lord Paramount; yet when they had conferred with the <hi>Prothonotaries,</hi> and ſaw the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of former times in ſuch caſes, They would not change the former courſes, notwithſtanding that their opinions were to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: So 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. The <hi>Venire facias</hi> is, 12 <hi>liberos &amp; legales homines,</hi> and the Sheriff retorned 24, and holden good, by reaſon of the uſual courſe of the Court in ſuch caſes; and yet in our Law, the number of perſons is not material, which ſee in the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Caſe, 15 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but cuſtome diſpenſeth with the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atkinſon</hi> argued the contrary; At the Common Law for Execution in Debt within the year, a <hi>Levari facias,</hi> and a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> lay; after the year the party was put to a new Original; and there was no <hi>Capias</hi> at the Common Law, but in caſes of contempt, force, or other notable misdemeanour, untill the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. which gave it in Debt, <hi>Detinue, &amp;c.</hi> And the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. gave <hi>Fieri Facias</hi> and <hi>Elegit,</hi> but no <hi>Capias</hi> was given upon a Recognizance by any Statute, and he relied much upon the Book of 48 <hi>E.</hi> 3. before cited, the rule of which Book is, That in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon an Original in which a <hi>Capias</hi> lieth, the <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall follow the nature of the Original upon which it is founded: but where a <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ad reſpondendum</hi> doth not lie, there not a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 451. In Debt againſt Executors, they appear and plead fully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and it is found againſt them, and Iudgment is given for the Plaintiff, who after the year ſueth a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Execution awarded by default, and thereupon a <hi>Capias</hi> and <hi>Exigent:</hi> And that matter being ſhewed to the Court, a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> was granted, becauſe the <hi>Capias improvide &amp; erronice emanavit:</hi> for no <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> lieth againſt Executors where they plead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although it be found againſt them, <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither a <hi>Scire facias</hi> grounded thereupon. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Stat. of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. gives a <hi>Capias</hi> in Debt, yet if Debt be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a <hi>Juſticies,</hi> a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie by the Equity of the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: and he relied very ſtrongly upon <hi>Puttenham</hi>'s Caſe, 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cited before. And as to that which hath been ſaid, That notwithſtanding, that the <hi>Capias</hi> was againſt the Law, and ſo his impriſonment by colour thereof wrongfully, yet, <hi>de facto,</hi> he was in Priſon, and the Sheriff hath taken him, and he ſhall excuſe himſelf in a falſe impriſonment brought; yet I ſay, That this erroneous Proceſs appearing to you, you will not again err, by allowing theſe erroneous proceedings, but rather reform them: For the Sheriff himſelf, who is a ſtranger to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, cannot have <hi>Error</hi> to reverſe theſe proceedings, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, unleſs the Court doth relieve him therein. And he ſaid farther, That this <hi>Capias, Poſito quod legitime emanavit,</hi> cannot faſten or work upon <hi>Francis Woodhouſe,</hi> being impriſoned, and convict of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; for being impriſoned, and reſtrained of his liberty, how can he (his reſtraint continuing) be <hi>de novo</hi> reſtrained before that he be enlarged and reſtored to his liverty? <hi>Nam omnis privatio praeſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit habitum;</hi> and <hi>Ergo,</hi> impriſonment, liberty precedent. And ſo he concluded, That <hi>Francis Woodhouſe, Neque de facto,</hi> nor <hi>de jure,</hi> was in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61358:48"/>
priſon: and that no <hi>Capias</hi> lieth in the Caſe, eſpecially after the year, as here it was, and the party being convict and in priſon, cannot be taken, <hi>&amp;c. Manwood,</hi> If within the year a <hi>Levari facias,</hi> or a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> be ſued forth and be retorned, not ſerved, or that <hi>Vicecomes non miſit Breve,</hi> and ſo the year paſſeth in the default of the Sheriff; yet the Plaintiff ſhall not be put to a <hi>Scire facias.</hi> At another day it was argued by <hi>Tanfield</hi> for the Defendant, That upon this <hi>Scire facias</hi> no <hi>Capias</hi> lieth, and then no lawfull Execution, and then no eſcape. Where there is no <hi>Capias</hi> in the Original, there is no <hi>Capias</hi> in the Execution, but here in our Caſe, there is not any Original, becauſe it is a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Recovery, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no <hi>Capias</hi> can be where there is not any Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. As to that which hath been ſaid, That the ancient Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and courſe in <hi>Cancel.</hi> is againſt us; be it ſo; yet the courſe in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> and <hi>Common Pleas</hi> is with us, That a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie in ſuch caſe of <hi>Scire facias.</hi> And the <hi>Chancery</hi> as to the <hi>Common Law</hi> ought not to vary from theſe Courts, for one and the ſame Common Law ought to be in all the ſaid Courts, of things of the Common Law, and the Preſidents alledged of the other ſide are ſilent, and ſleeping proceedings and preſidents, Slips of Clarks, which were never drawn into queſtion; the ancienteſt of which was hatcht but in the later part of the Reign of King <hi>H.</hi> 8. And if the Common Law doth not warrant ſuch Executions, Truly the preſidents cannot make ſuch impriſonments lawfull without Act of Parliament. It hath been ſaid, that Executions ought to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, that is true, but alſo Liberty, to which the Law hath ſpecial reſpect: See the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel impriſonetur, niſi per legale judicium parium ſuorum, vel per legem terrae;</hi> and this is not <hi>Lex terrae,</hi> but uſage onely: and <hi>Malus uſus eſt abolendus,</hi> 26 <hi>Eliz. Error</hi> was brought upon a Iudgment given <hi>in Curia de Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock,</hi> which is a Court of Record, and Error aſſigned, for that they had awarded Execution <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem Villae,</hi> againſt one who had bailed the Defendant without a <hi>Scire facias</hi> firſt ſued forth againſt him, <hi>i.</hi> the bailee, and it was adjudged <hi>Error,</hi> and the cuſtome could not maintain it, for the Bailee might have a releaſe or other matter of diſcharge to plead: And he cited the Caſe of 13 and 14 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 306. That upon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> out of a Recognizance in <hi>Chancery,</hi> Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, and the Warden of the <hi>Fleet</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to detain the Conuſor in his cuſtody, in Execution for the Plaintiff, and afterwards the Conuſor eſcaped, the Plaintiff not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, And it was holden no eſcape, for his body was not liable; in caſe of a Recognizance, to the Execution: and ſee alſo the book of <hi>Entries,</hi> 500 there is a Rule put, If the Recognizee will have execution within the year, he may have a <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> or <hi>Elegit,</hi> but not a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum.</hi> And he conceived; that this Proceſs is not onely erroneous; but alſo utterly void: As a <hi>Capias</hi> in a <hi>Formedon,</hi>

Another matter he moved, becauſe this iſſue is not well tried, for it was tried by <hi>Niſi prius</hi> out of the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> and the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. do not give <hi>Niſi prius</hi> in Cauſes out of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> but onely out of both <hi>Benches;</hi> but Cauſes out of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> are tried by Commiſſion; and here their Commiſſion was inſufficient; for it was directed, <hi>Chr.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61358:49"/>
Sheriff ſhall be charged, is, that one cannot be in Execution but once; and then if the Sheriff ſhould not be charged, the party Plaintiff ſhould by negligence of the Sheriff loſe his Suit, and alſo his Debt: And admit that a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lie in the Caſe, yet the Execution by force thereof is not void, but voidable onely; and Error may be aſſigned as well in the Execution, as in the Iudgment; which ſee 17 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 24. where the Recognizor in a Statute Merchant aliened the Land, and afterwards the Conuſee ſued forth Execution, ſo as the Land was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſuppoſing the payment, <hi>i.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Manwood,</hi> chief Baron, argued, That the Plaintiff ſhould recover; and he put the Caſe of Recognizance: The Plaintiff ſueth two <hi>Scire facias</hi>'s, upon which two <hi>Nichel's</hi> are retorned; and afterwards a <hi>Levari facias,</hi> and upon that alſo <hi>Nihil</hi> is retorned, and then iſſueth a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> for to take the ſaid <hi>Francis Woodhouſe,</hi> who then was in Priſon for Felony, upon which <hi>Capias</hi> the Sheriff did arreſt him, and he being afterwards convicted of Felony, eſcaped; upon this matter Debt is brought againſt the Sheriff. A Recognizance taken in the <hi>Chancery</hi> is a thing upon Record in a Court of Record, an Obligation of Record, and a Debt upon Record. It hath been objected, where no <hi>Capias</hi> lieth in the Proceſs upon the Original, there no <hi>Capias</hi> lieth upon the Execution: but it is good to examine the Reaſon thereof; for <hi>Lex plus laudatur quando ratione probatur:</hi> The <hi>Capias</hi> upon a Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance is not by 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. but by the common Law: for here is a Debt upon Record, wherefore ſhall not this body be ſubject to it, as well as in the caſe of a Debt upon a bare Obligation? I do admit the Rule, That where there is no <hi>Capias ad reſpondendum,</hi> there is no <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> but that ought to be intended in caſes where there is an Original, and Meſn Proceſs before Iudgment; but here is no Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, nor Meſn Proceſs before Iudgment, <hi>ergo,</hi> our Caſe is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame Rule: But I will put a good Rule; It is Debt upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <hi>ergo</hi> a <hi>Capias</hi> lieth: In the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> If the Defendant comes in by <hi>Latitat,</hi> if the cauſe whereof the Action is brought be of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he is to put in ſpecial Bail; and thoſe who bail him ſhall be bounden in a Recognizance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendant is condemned in the Action: Now if the Defendant cannot be found, ſo as Execution may be ſued forth againſt him, then a <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall iſſue forth againſt the Sureties which bailed him, and upon that a <hi>Capias,</hi> and that is very frequent therein uſe: So alſo is the courſe of the Court of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas; ergo</hi> it ſhall be ſo in the <hi>Chancery</hi> in caſe of a Recognizance. If one be taken in Execution upon a Statute Staple, and ſueth an <hi>Audita Querela</hi> upon a Releaſe, or other matter, and be bound with Sureties in the double value, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the King, and to the party: If he be condemned in the <hi>Audita Querela, &amp;c.</hi> and cannot be found, a <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall iſſue forth againſt the Sureties, and thereupon a <hi>Capias.</hi> And this queſtion, If the <hi>Capias</hi> in this caſe lieth, or not? is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided either by <hi>Audita Querela</hi> in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> or by <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench:</hi> for the ſaid Courts have authority to affirm the proceedings,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61358:49"/>
or to diſaffirm them. And here the Queſtion was, If <hi>Woodhouſe</hi> were impriſoned or no? and not, if the <hi>Capias erronice emanavit</hi> or not? And he took a difference where Proceſs is awarded out of a Court which hath not authority of the Principal cauſe; there it is <hi>coram non judice,</hi> and the Proceſs is void; and if the Sheriff taketh the party by force of ſuch Proceſs, it is meerly void, and he a Treſpaſſor; but contrary if the Court hath authority of the principal cauſe, there if the Proceſs be miſconceived, it is onely erroneous.<note place="margin">10 Co. 76.</note> An unskilfull man in <hi>Chancery</hi> makes an Appeal of Murther, retornable in the <hi>Common Pleas;</hi> and there an unskilfull Clark makes a <hi>Capias</hi> upon it, the ſame is <hi>coram non-judice,</hi> and not all together void: But if in a <hi>Writ of Entry,</hi> in the nature of an <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> the Demandant hath Iudgment to recover Debt and Damages, and thereupon iſſueth a <hi>Capias,</hi> the ſame is not void, for it is but a miſawarding of the Proceſs, <hi>&amp; provide emanavit.</hi> If out of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> immediately a <hi>Writ</hi> iſſueth to the Sheriff of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> which is a County Palatine, where the King's <hi>Writ</hi> doth not run, the ſame is void, and falſe impriſonment lieth upon ſuch a taking. A <hi>Formedon</hi> brought in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and upon that a <hi>Capias,</hi> is void, <hi>&amp; coram non judice;</hi> and the Sheriff is bound to take notice of the Law in ſuch caſes, that thoſe of the <hi>King's Bench</hi> have not authority to hold plea in real Actions. As to that, That <hi>Woodhouſe</hi> was convict of Felony, the ſame ſhall not avoid the Execution; but I grant, that the King ſhall be ſatisfied before the ſubject, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he relied much upon the ſaid Caſe cited before, 13 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Bar.</hi> 253. as to the matter of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias:</hi> 19 <hi>H.</hi> 9. In Eſcape the Defendant pleaded a Releaſe of him who recovered to the Priſoner being in Execution, and it was holden no Plea. And in the principal Caſe Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

                  <p>THE Caſe was, <hi>Clark</hi> was indebted to <hi>Archdel</hi> by Obligation, and afterwards delivered to <hi>Andrews</hi> certain Hogſheads of Wine to ſatisfie the ſaid <hi>Archdel</hi> the ſaid Debt: and afterwards the Obligation of <hi>Clark</hi> is aſſigned to the <hi>Queen</hi> for the Debt of <hi>Archdel:</hi> And if the property of the ſaid Hogſheads of Wine were altered by the delivery of them to <hi>Andrews</hi> before the Aſſignment? was the Queſtion. <hi>Egerton,</hi> Solicitor, The property is not altered, for the Bailor might have an Action of Account againſt <hi>Andrews</hi> before that he hath delivered the ſame over according to the Bailment: but if he hath delivered them over, the ſame is a good bar in an Account: But if one be accountable to me upon a Bailment, and afterwards I do require him to deliver the Goods over to <hi>A.</hi> the ſame is not in bar of Account, but is good in diſcharge of account before Auditors; for the ſame is matter after the Bailment, not upon the Bailment. If Goods be bailed to bail over upon a conſideration precedent of his part to whom they ought to be bailed, the Bailor cannot countermand it; otherwiſe it is, where it is voluntary and without conſideration; but where it is in conſideration of a Debt not countermandable, contrary, if it be to ſatisfie the Debt of another. <hi>Manwood,</hi> Where the Debtor of the King is ſufficient there a Debt due to him ought not to be aſſigned to the King, but onely where the Debt of the King is doubtfull, and that was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient courſe; but now at this day <hi>multi videntur &amp; habentur divites, qui tamen non ſunt;</hi> and therefore <hi>omnis Ratio tentanda eſt,</hi> for the Recovery of the King's Debts. But as to the Caſe before us; The Wife is Executrix to her Husband, who was indebted to <hi>Archdel,</hi> and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the Goods to <hi>Andrews</hi> to ſatisfie <hi>Archdel,</hi> and all that is before the Aſſignment: And I am of Opinion, That the property of the ſaid
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61358:50"/>
Goods is altered; for, as the caſe is, <hi>Andrews</hi> was Surety for <hi>Clark,</hi> and hath a Counter-Bond of <hi>Clark</hi> to ſave him harmleſs: If I borrow 100<hi>l.</hi> and deliver unto the Lender Plate for the ſecurity of it, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty general of it is in me, yet the Bailee hath a ſpecial intereſt in it, untill he be paid.

An Executor hath Goods of the Teſtators, and he with his own Monies payeth the Debts of the Teſtator, he ſhall retain the Goods, and the property is altered. And here in our caſe, <hi>Andrews</hi> may by virtue of this Bailment ſell the Goods, and with the Monies ariſing thereof pay the ſaid <hi>Archdel.</hi> And afterwards Iudgment was given accordingly, that the property of the Goods by the delivery over by <hi>Andrews</hi> was altered.</p>

                     <hi>FRancis Foskew,</hi> ſeiſed of the Manor of <hi>Foskew</hi> in his Demeſn as of fee in conſideration of a Marriage to be had with <hi>Francis</hi> his Son with <hi>M.</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Edw.

And now <hi>Coke</hi> came into Court, and prayed that the ſaid Manor might be diſcharged of the Debt to the <hi>Queen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not chargeable by the ſaid Statute; the words of whicih Statute are, <hi>All Manors, Lands, Tenements, &amp;c. which hereafter ſhall deſcend, remain, or revert in Fee-ſimple, tail general or ſpecial, by, from, or after the death of any his or their Anceſtor or Anceſtors as Heir, or by Gift of his Anceſtor whoſe Heir he is; which ſaid Anceſtor or Anceſtors was, is, or ſhall be indebted to the King, or any other perſon or perſons to his uſe, by Judgment, Recognizance, Obligation, &amp;c. In every ſuch caſe, the ſaid Manors, &amp;c. ſhall be charged, &amp;c.</hi> This Statute was made for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the King in two points: 1. To make Lands entailed liable to the King againſt the iſſue tail for the Kings Debts in the caſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, where they were not liable. 2. To make Bonds taken by the Officers of the King to the uſe of the King, as alſo of Statutes. We cannot deny but that we have Lands of the Conuſor, and of the Gift of the Conuſor our Anceſtor, whoſe Heir we are, who was indebted to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and yet we are not within this Statute: <hi>Was or ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted,</hi> ſhall not be intended after the Gift made; for if he firſt convey his Land, and afterwards becomes indebted, the ſame is not within the Statute: and where a miſchief is to be remedied by a Statute, the remedy in expoſition of the Statute is to be applied according as the miſchief doth require: <hi>[Shall be]</hi> is to be intended of future Debts after the Statute: and in our caſe, the Father was not Receivor, or other Officer to the <hi>Queen:</hi> And if this Statute ſhould be ſo conſtrued, the Father might take 10000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Marriage of his ſon, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Lands unto him; and then if he will acknowledge a Debt to the <hi>Queen,</hi> he ſhould defeat the whole, which ſhould be a very great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: The words are, <hi>[By Gift after the Debt acknowledged to the Queen.]</hi> And he cited the Caſe, 19 <hi>Eliz. Plow.</hi> 191. betwixt <hi>Ludford</hi> and <hi>Gretton,</hi> upon the Statute of 18 <hi>H.</hi> 6. the words of which are, [<hi>That whatſoever Warrant hereafter to the Chancellor of</hi> England <hi>addreſſed, the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61358:50"/>
day of the delivery of the ſame it be entred of Record in the</hi> Chancery; <hi>and that the Chancellour make Letters Patents upon the ſame Warrants, bearing date the day of the ſaid delivery in the</hi> Chancery, <hi>and not before: and all Letters Patents made to the contrary ſhall be void.</hi>] And the Caſe was, That a Warrant was directed to the Chancellour, for the making of Letters Patents, and delivered to him before the making of them, but the day of the delivery was not entred of Record, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was holden, that notwithſtanding that, the Letters Patents were good; for the miſchief at the Common Law intended to be reformed by that Act, was not the <hi>poſt</hi>-dating of the Letters Patents, but the <hi>ante</hi>-da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and therefore that ought to be principally taken into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which miſchief being underſtood, the words of the ſaid Statute are to be applied to it; <hi>ipſae etenim Leges cupiunt, ut jure regantur; i.</hi> with an Equity according to the Miſchief, and not always according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe words: and in that caſe it is ſufficient if the Letters Patents bear date after, and not before the delivery of the Warrant, and that was the matter intended to be reformed. Alſo, as our Caſe here is, we are not within this Statute; for the words are, <hi>Of the Gift of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtour,</hi> but here the Son hath not the Lands of the Gift of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, but rather by the Statute of Vſes, and ſo he is in the <hi>Poſt</hi> and not in the <hi>Per,</hi> by his Anceſtour; for here the Fine was levied to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons unto the Vſes aforeſaid: and here the Gift was not a mere gratuity to his Son, but in conſideration that he ſhould marry the Daughter of Sir <hi>Edw. Huddleſton;</hi> and alſo the Father was the King's Debtor after the Gift, and not before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> Attorney-General, to the contrary: The letter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is with us, for he comes in of the Gift of his Anceſtour, who was indebted to the Queen: and although that the Gift was by way of uſe, yet the precedents in the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> and other Courts are, That he may declare, of the Feoffment of ſuch a one, although it was by way of uſe: and he ſaid, If <hi>A.</hi> be bound to enfeoff <hi>B.</hi> of ſuch Lands, if he maketh a Feoffment to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> and his Heirs, he hath well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough performed the Condition: and if the Caſe ſhould not be within the Statute, then ſhould that branch of the Statute be idle, and to no purpoſe: For if the Anceſtour be ſeiſed, and becometh indebted to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and after makes a conveyance <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> the ſame is provided for by the firſt branch of the Statute: For the Land is liable to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance or Obligation made to the King, and that they ſhall be as effectual as a Statute Staple; and reaſon requires, that the ſon, who comes in by mere gratuity of his Anceſtour, ſhould be charged: And it was a common practice before the making of that Statute, That the King's Officers would convey their Lands to their children, and then become the King's Debtors; for the remedy of which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief the Statute was made, and the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Heir, becauſe he is Heir, but as a purchaſor onely, and that upon good conſideration: <hi>Coke,</hi> If any fraud can be found in our Caſe, then without doubt we ſhould be within the Statute, but being upon good conſideration, it is out of the Statute; nor was there any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the father when he made the ſaid Conveyance, to become the King's Debtor, or Officer to him, for if there were, then he is within the Statute, alſo the Gift had been a mere gratuity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, at another day, the Caſe was moved by <hi>Coke,</hi> and he ſaid, That here is not any Gift, becauſe it was in conſideration of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and then no gift, for it is an old Proverb, What is freer than gift? <hi>Egerton,</hi> The father giveth to his ſon and heir, the ſame is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute, and yet here is conſideration, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> of blood; <hi>Coke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Where the father giveth to his younger ſon, or to his daughter, which is not his heir; and of that opinion was <hi>Manwood,</hi> chief Baron: And afterwards, (as <hi>Coke</hi> reported) the ſon and his Lands were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>

The Caſe was, That one <hi>Weldon</hi> was ſeiſed, and leaſed unto <hi>Pierpoint</hi> for ninety nine years, who devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame by his Will in this manner; <hi>I bequeath to my Wife the Leaſe of my Houſe during her life, and after her death I will that it go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my Children unpreferred. Pierpoint</hi> died, his Wife entred, and was poſſeſſed <hi>virtute legationis praedict.</hi> and took Husband one <hi>Fulſhurſt,</hi> againſt whom one <hi>Beſwick</hi> recovered in an Action of Debt 140 <hi>l.</hi> upon which Recovery iſſued forth a <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> and upon that a <hi>Venditioni Exponas,</hi> upon which the Sheriff ſold the ſaid term ſo deviſed to one <hi>Reynolds: Fulſhurſt</hi> died, his Executor brought Error to reverſe the Iudgment given againſt the Teſtator at the Suit of <hi>Beſwick;</hi> the Wife did re-enter, and ſold the Land, and died. <hi>Alice,</hi> an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Daughter of <hi>Pierpoint,</hi> did enter, and upon that matter found by ſpecial Verdict in the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> the entry of <hi>Alice</hi> was adjudged lawfull: upon which Iudgment Error was brought in the <hi>King's-Bench.</hi> And it was argued upon the words of the Deviſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here the Houſe is not deviſed, but the Leaſe it ſelf, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> all his intereſt in the thing deviſed: And it is not like unto the Caſe betwixt <hi>Welchden</hi> and <hi>Elkington,</hi> 20 <hi>Eliz. Plow.</hi> 519. where the Caſe was, That <hi>Davis</hi> being Leſſee for years, deviſed that his Wife ſhould have and occupy the Land demiſed for ſo many years as ſhe ſhould live; nor unto the Caſe of <hi>Paramour</hi> and <hi>Yardley,</hi> 21 <hi>Eliz. Plow.</hi> 539. for there the Leſſe deviſed, That his Wife ſhall have the occupation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Lands untill the full age of his Son: For in theſe two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Land it ſelf is <hi>quodam modo</hi> deviſed, but in our Caſe all the Eſtate is deviſed, <hi>i.</hi> the Leaſe it ſelf. And alſo in thoſe two Caſes a certain perſon is aſſigned and named in the Will, who ſhould take the reſidue of the term which ſhould be expired after the death of the Wife: But in the Caſe at Bar, there is not any perſon certain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Deviſe, as to that, is conceived in general words, <hi>to Children unpreferred;</hi> therefore neither any poſſibility, nor Remainder in any perſon certain, therefore all the term is wholly in the Wife, and then ſhe might well diſpoſe the whole. But all the Court was to the Contrary, and that in this caſe the poſſibility ſhould riſe well enough to the death of the Wife, to that Daughter unprefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Another matter was moved, If the ſaid term, being ſold in the poſſeſſion of the Wife of the Deviſor by force of the Execution afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; If now, the judgment being reverſed, the ſale of the term be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo avoided? for now the party is to be reſtored to all that which he had loſt.

It was argued by <hi>Godfrey</hi> for the Plaintiff; Where injury or wrong is done unto any, the Law gives remedy to the party grieved; and although that the Shop was let un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to lay wares there, which he hath done, and that it was not his intent to ſurcharge the ſaid Warehouſe, although the event be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet foraſmuch as by the laying of wares there, a wrong and damage follow to the Plaintiff, the Defendant ſhall be puniſhed; for the rule is <hi>Sic utere tuo, ut alienum non laedas:</hi> If I have a houſe, and another buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo high over me, that rain-water deſcends and falls from his houſe upon my houſe, an Action upon the Caſe lieth, See <hi>F.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61358:52"/>
Defendant answers thereunto. That the floor fell in default of repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the walls of the Cellar, or for the ruinouſneſs of them, where he ought to have pleaded farther, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that the Shop was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the intent to hurt the Plaintiff's Wines; In an Action upon the Caſe, upon a <hi>Trover,</hi> The Defendant pleads, that the goods whereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were pawned unto him for the ſecurity of certain money not yet paid, The ſame is no plea without ſaying farther, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that he did convert, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 33. In an Action brought againſt a Smith, for his negligence in curing of a Horſe which he took upon him to cure; the Defendant was driven to traverſe, <hi>Abſque hoc,</hi> that the Horſe periſhed in default of his care: <hi>Dalton</hi> contrary, Where in doing of a lawfull Act, by a miſhap a damage cometh to another, againſt the will of the doer, no puniſhment ſhall follow: See the Caſe cited by the other ſide in 6 <hi>E</hi> 4. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. If he might have done more than he had done to have prevented the miſchief, he ſhould be puniſhed; but if he could not have done more than he hath done, or otherwiſe than he hath done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, he is diſpuniſhable, and he may, <hi>Uti jure ſuo,</hi> although it be to the prejudice of another: See 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Caſe; If I cannot otherwiſe let the water out of my Land, I may juſtifie the letting of it in your Land which is adjoining, although that your Land be drowned thereby: Sometimes ignorance of the party ſhall excuſe the offence: As if my Dog worry your Sheep, if I do not know of ſuch ill quality in him, I ſhall not be puniſhed for the ſame. And it doth not appear that the Defendant had notice of the ruinouſneſs of the walls, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now it appeareth that they were ruinous, and for that cauſe the floorfell; for the Defendant ſaid, That the walls were ruinous, <hi>in occultis &amp; abſconditis partibus ipſorum;</hi> And here needs not any Traverſe: For it is confeſſed, That the floor of the Shop was ſurcharged, but the ſame is avoided and excuſed, becauſe that the walls were ruinous, <hi>in occultis &amp; abſconditis ipſorum partibus;</hi> And foraſmuch as our Landlord (who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Landlord of the Plaintiff,) hath let to us the Shop, to lay there the weight of 30 Tun, therefore the Defendant hath good right, as to ſuch weight againſt the Leſſor of the Plaintiff, and all others, claiming under him. And here the Plaintiff hath declared of a Leaſe from week to week, <hi>Quamdiu ambabus partibus placuerit,</hi> and hath not averred the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his Leaſe, <hi>&amp;c. Godfrey,</hi> A Leaſe is made from year to year, <hi>ut ſupra, &amp;c.</hi> The Leſſor brings Debt for the ſecond year, he need not to aver the continuance of the Leaſe; for when the ſecond year doth begin, the Leſſor cannot put him out that year; But we, upon the matter, have averred the continuance, for we have ſaid, <hi>Et ſic poſſeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus exiſtens, &amp;c. Manwood,</hi> The Declaration is, That the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, <hi>Nequitur &amp; malitioſe intendens, &amp;c. tantum ponderis,</hi> was laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the floor, <hi>Ita quod vi ponderis dirupta fuit contabulatio:</hi> And the Plea of the Defendant is, <hi>Quod muri in partibus occultis &amp; abſconditis ruinoſi fuerunt, &amp;c. &amp; ideo corruerunt.</hi> So as the Plaintiff ſpeaks of the floor, and the Defendant of the walls, and ſo the Defendant doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Plaintiff; for the Shopman ought not to go into the Cellar, nor the Cellar-man into the walls. But <hi>Dalton</hi> ſaid, That the Plea was, <hi>Quod diruptio &amp; fractio contabulationis fuit ex eo quod muri ruinoſi fuerunt in partibus occultis &amp; abſconditis.</hi> At another day, it was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by <hi>Flemming</hi> for the Plaintiff, A voluntary and unlawfull act is laid to the charge of the Defendant, who pleads ſpecial matter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, but doth not answer the point of the Action, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the fall was ſudden, <hi>Et quia muri fuerunt ruinoſi in partibus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultis, &amp;c.</hi> whereas we have declared, that the weight was the cauſe thereof: 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Double Plea</hi> 31. In an Action upon the Caſe, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent keeping of fire, the houſe of the Plaintiff was burnt, he ought to take a Traverſe, without that, that it was burnt by the ill keeping of the fire of the Defendant; and he needs not to aver the continuance

of the Tenancy at will: 38 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 27. A Leſſee for life aſſigns his Eſtate to <hi>B.</hi> who Leaſes at will to <hi>C.

B.</hi> ſaith, that he is a Baſtard, there needs no Traverſe. We have confeſſed in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Quod gravitate ponderis,</hi> the floor fell down; but we ſay farther, that the cauſe was, becauſe the walls were ruinous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here is matter in Law; Who ought to repair them: The Leaſe was made unto the Defendant, 29 <hi>Julii,</hi> and the floor fell 30 <hi>Julii,</hi> the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and if by Law the Defendant ought to repair them, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to do it, and that ſhall excuſe him: If one hath a Shop, and another a Cellar under it, and the Shop <hi>minatur rainam,</hi> there is a <hi>Writ</hi> in the Regiſter, <hi>De reparatione facienda.</hi> 153, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it lieth againſt him who ought to repair by preſcription, or by the Law. And we who are the Leſſee, are not bound to repair; for if the ground Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be in decay, and ſo the houſe ruinous at the time of the Leaſe, it is a good Plea in an Action of Waſte, if the houſe fell in ſuch defect; for the Leſſee is not bound to ſuch reparation, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> for great timber, which was rotten at the time of the Leaſe. But if after the Leaſe it becomes rotten for want of covering, it is otherwiſe, See 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 1. And here the Plaintiff hath remedy againſt his Leſſor, for he is bound to the reparations by the Law, and not the Leſſee; And as he may have the ſaid <hi>Writ, De reparatione facienda,</hi> before the miſchief, ſo he may now have after the miſchief: and therefore no Law binds the Defendant to repair; Nor is there any cuſtome pleaded to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and alſo for as much as the occaſion of the Cauſe of action was the ruinouſneſs of the walls, the Defendant ſhall not be charged with the ſame: And alſo he ſhall not be charged with a thing he could not prevent. <hi>Manwood,</hi> The Defendant hath pleaded, that the fall of the floor was, <hi>eo quod,</hi> the walls were ruinous <hi>in partibus occultis,</hi> which was a ſecret thing, and unknown unto the Defendant, upon which the Plaintiff hath demurred, and ſo confeſſed the plea of the Defendant to be true; and that he was ignorant of the feebleneſs of the walls, and therefore he needs not any Traverſe. And here the Defendant hath pleaded, That the Shop was demiſed to him for greater carriage. <hi>Gent,</hi> Baron, was of opinion, That the Defendant had not fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to the Declaration; for he is charged with the laying of ſo much weight upon the floor there, ſo as, <hi>vi ponderis,</hi> it fell down; To which the Defendant hath ſaid, That the walls were ruinous, <hi>in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultis partibus;</hi> and doth not anſwer to the ſurcharging, <hi>(ſcil.) Abſque hoc,</hi> that he did ſurcharge it: <hi>Clark,</hi> Baron, It is a general Rule, That every material thing alledged in the pleading, ought to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, confeſſed and avoided, which the Defendant hath not done here but he would excuſe himſelf through the default of another, and anſwer nothing to that with which he himſelf is charged; And afterwards Iudgment was given in the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> for the Plaintiff. Whereupon, afterwards, the Defendant brought a <hi>Writ</hi> of Error in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> where the Caſe was argued again; But there the Iudgment given in the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> was affirmed.

                     <note place="margin">1 Cro. 168, 169.</note>IN an Action upon the Caſe, for ſlanderous words, the Plaintiff declared, That where, by the cuſtome of the City of <hi>London,</hi> it hath been uſed, If the Mayor, Recorder, or any Alderman, being a Iuſtice of Peace there, might take the Depoſition of any perſon produced before them, or any of them to be depoſed <hi>in perpetuum rei memoriam ex parte alicujus perſonae,</hi> which Depoſitions are there recorded, <hi>in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuam rei memoriam;</hi> and are good matter to be given in Evidence to any Iury there to inform their conſciences of the truth of the thing in Queſtion, and declared farther, That he himſelf was produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one <hi>Bond,</hi> as a Witneſs to teſtifie his knowledge <hi>in quadam cauſa ibid. ex parte Edw. Stapleton,</hi> before whom he depoſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſpake theſe words in ſcandal of the Plaintiff, <hi>Rymerſly was forſworn in the ſaid oath before, &amp;c.</hi> The Defendant pleaded, That the Plaintiff made not any ſuch oath, and upon that the Plaintiff did demur in Law. <hi>George Crook</hi> prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff, for the ſame is no plea; for the oath is but an Inducement, and therefore not traverſable; for the ground of the Action is the ſpeaking of the words; and admit there were not any ſuch Oath taken by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, the offence of the Defendant was the greater, <hi>Nam peccavit in utroque, tam in juramento, quod nullum omnino fuit, quam in perjurio, quod ſine juramento eſſe non potuit;</hi> for if one ſaith, <hi>A. Murdravit J. S.</hi> whereas there never was any ſuch <hi>J. S.</hi> yet the Action lieth for the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous words: Alſo this Plea doth amount but to the general iſſue, See 4 <hi>E.</hi> 6. Action, <hi>Sur le Caſe</hi> 113. 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 28. And as to the words, they are Actionable; for (forsworn) amounts to purjured, being ſpoken upon on oath taken in a Court of Record, and ſo was it lately holden in the Caſe betwixt <hi>Brook</hi> and <hi>Doughty:</hi>

                     <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Contrary, The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is not good, for the cuſtome in <hi>London</hi> is not well laid, or purſued; and therefore, upon the matter, it is but an oath taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a private man; for he hath declared, That in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> it hath been uſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but doth not ſay, That the City of <hi>London</hi> is <hi>Antiqua Civitas,</hi> as he ought.

If a man alledgeth a cuſtome within a Town, he ought firſt preſcribe, That the ſaid Town is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Town. Alſo it is not ſet forth in the Declaration: That <hi>Bond,</hi> at the time of the Depoſition taken, was a Iuſtice of Peace in <hi>London,</hi> and then the cuſtome is not well perſued. But afterwards, the Record was looked upon, and allowed to be good by the Court, and the Court conceived, that the Plea of the Defendant was good enough, as 13 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. In Debt againſt an Abbat, the Plaintiff counted upon a borrowing by the predeceſſor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Defendant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That he did not borrow, and it was holden a good Plea, and yet the Plaintiff in ſuch Caſe might plead the general iſſue, See

As in Debt upon a Bond againſt <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.

Dyer</hi> 115. Leſſee for years covenants that he will not cut any Trees, The Leſſor aſſigns the breach of the Covenant <hi>in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidendo</hi> twenty Oaks, The Leſſee pleads, that he did not cut the twenty Trees, nor any of them; The Iury found, that the Defendant had cut down ten Trees, The Plaintiff upon that Verdict ſhall have Iudgment, for the reſt is but ſurpluſage; and more put in iſſue than there needs to be. <hi>Fenner,</hi> It is not any full Plea to ſay, That the Plaintiff did not depart out of the ſervice of the Defendant 4 <hi>Maii,</hi> for if ſhe departeth at any other time, ſhe ſhall not recover, for which cauſe ſhe ought to have pleaded, That ſhe continued in his ſervice untill ſuch a day, and then ſhe departed with his licence, and the inducement to the traverſe ought to be ſufficient matter, otherwiſe it is not a full Plea, nor the Traverſe is not good. And if it be ſurpluſage, yet if it be not matter againſt her ſelf, it makes the Plea naught, which ſee 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 29. 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>Gawdy</hi> conceived, that the Iudgment was well given, for the Defendant was at his liberty to plead the departure of the Plaintiff without his licence, or to ſtand upon the demand. And now, although he pleads the departure, yet the demand is not confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And afterwards the Iudgment given in the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> was affirmed.</p>

                     <hi>Egerton,</hi> Solicitor to the contrary; This Traverſe is not good; for he that traverſeth, hath not made Title to himſelf as he ought, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Queen</hi> may take Iſſue; for it is at the Election of the <hi>Queen</hi> to maintain her own Title, or traverſe the Title of the party. At the Common Law, no Traverſe lay but where the Livery might be ſued; but that is helped by the Statute of 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. but where the King is entituled by double matter of Record (as in our caſe he is) no Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is allowed until 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. And in ſuch caſe two things are requiſite: 1. That the Office be untruly found: 2. That the party, who is to be admitted to his Traverſe, have juſt Title or Intereſt of Eſtate of Freehold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in our caſe, The Office is confeſſed by the Traverſe to be true, although that the Conveyance be not truly found: Alſo <hi>Harris,</hi> at the time of the Office found, had not juſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle but an intereſt came unto him long time after the Office found: Alſo the Traverſe is not good, for he traverſeth the matter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, which is not traverſable; for if the King hath Title, <hi>non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert quomodo,</hi> or by what Conveyance he hath it. As to the matter in Law, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Tenant in tail in Remainder is attainted of Felony, if the King during the life of Tenant in tail ſhall have the freehold? and he conceived that he ſhould, for it ſhall not be in abeyance, and it cannot be in any other; for when he is attainted, he is dead as unto the King. The chief Lord cannot have it, for Tenant for life is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and alſo he in the Remainder in Fee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Donor ſhall not have it, for the Tenant in Remainder is not naturally dead, but ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy; and the Land cannot revert before the Tenant in tail be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dead without iſſue: but if there were any other in whom the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold might veſt and remain, then the King ſhould not have the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but onely the profits. So if the Tenant be attainted, the Lord ſhall have the Lands preſently; 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. The Husband, ſeiſed in the right of his Wife, is attainted of Felony; the King ſhall have but the profits, for the Freehold veſts in the Wife, and if the Lord entreth,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61358:67"/>
the Wife ſhall have an Aſſiſe. And Tenant in tail may forfeit for his life, as he may grant for his life: See <hi>Old N. B.</hi> 99. If Tenant in tail, for life, dower, or by the curteſie, be attainted of Felony, the King ſhall have the Lands during their lives; and after their deceaſes, he in the Reverſion ſhall ſue unto the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Petition,</hi> and ſhall have the Lands out of the <hi>King</hi>'s hands: and there it is farther ſaid, That the Lord by Eſcheat cannot have it, for the party attainted was not his very Tenant, nor he in the Reverſion, for the term yet endures. But now it is to ſee, if the Freehold be in the <hi>King</hi> without Office? and he conceived and argued, that it was: Where the <hi>King</hi> is entituled to an Action, there the <hi>King</hi> ought to have an Office, and a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon it: as where the <hi>King</hi> is entituled to a <hi>Ceſſavit, Action of Waſte, &amp;c.</hi> 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 21. where the Entry in caſe of a common perſon is neceſſary, there it is requiſite that there be an Office for the <hi>King:</hi> As if a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain of the <hi>King</hi> purchaſeth Lands, or an Alien born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition broken, <hi>Mortmain, &amp;c.</hi> And in ſome caſes, an Office is onely neceſſary to inſtruct the <hi>King</hi> how he ſhall charge the Officer for the profits which may be ſupplied as well by Survey, as by Office: as if the <hi>King</hi> be to take by deſcent, or as the Caſe is here. And true it is, that a perſon attainted of Felony may during his Attainder purchaſe Lands, and yet he cannot hold it againſt the <hi>King:</hi> and it is clear, that by the Common Law in ſuch caſes, the Land was in the <hi>King,</hi> but not to grant, for the <hi>Statute</hi> of 18 <hi>H.</hi> 6. was an impediment to it: but now that defect is ſupplied by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. So that now the <hi>King</hi> may grant without Office: See <hi>Doughtie</hi>'s Caſe, 26 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And in our Caſe, an Office is not neceſſary to entitle the <hi>King,</hi> but for explaining of his Title: and ſee 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. The Lands of a man attainted of High Treaſon are in the <hi>King</hi> without Office; ſo where the <hi>King</hi>'s Tenant dieth without Heir; or Tenant in tail of the Gift of the <hi>King</hi> dieth without iſſue: See <hi>Br. Office</hi> before the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheator</hi> 34. and ſee 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 270. A man is attainted of Treaſon, the <hi>King</hi> before Office grants his Lands and Goods. Things which lie in Grant, as Advowſons, Rents, Remainder, ſuch things upon At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder are in the <hi>King</hi> without Office. As to the general pardon of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> he ſaid, That that doth not extend to this Caſe; and that this intereſt of the <hi>Queen</hi> by this Attainder doth not paſs by that pardon out of the <hi>Queen,</hi> ſo if the <hi>Queen</hi> had but a Right or Title onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> Attorney General; By this Attainder the Eſtate of him in the Remainder in tail, accrueth unto the <hi>Queen</hi> for the life of him in the Remainder; for by our Law, Felony is puniſhed by the death of the Offendor, and the loſs of his Goods and Lands for the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others, therefore nothing is left in the party: Tenant for life is attainted of Felony, the <hi>King</hi> pardoneth him his life, yet he ſhall have his Lands during his life, and he may diſpoſe of the ſame for his life: And ſo is it of Tenant in tail, for he may forfeit all that which he hath, and that is an Eſtate for his life, which is a Freehold. If Lands be given to one and his Heirs for the term of the life of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Donee be attainted of Felony, the <hi>King</hi> ſhall have the Land during the life of <hi>Ceſtuy que vie,</hi> for the Heir cannot have it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bloud is corrupt, and there is not any occupancy in the caſe: for 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Iuſtices would not accept of a Fine for the life of another, becauſe there might be an Occupant in the caſe: But for a Fine of Land to one and his Heirs for the life of another, they would take a Fine, for there is no miſchief of occupancy. Land is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>A.</hi> for life, the Remainder to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>A.</hi> who is attainted of Felony; <hi>B.</hi> dieth, now the <hi>King</hi> hath the Fee executed. And here in our Caſe, If the Tenant for life had been dead, no <hi>Praecipe</hi> had lien againſt him in the Remainder
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61358:67"/>
being in poſſeſſion, but the party who hath right is to ſue unto the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Petition.</hi> 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. If one ſeiſed of Lands in the right of his Wife for life be attainted, the <hi>King</hi> ſhall have <hi>exitus &amp; proficua:</hi> but he conceived that Caſe not to be Law: For ſee <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 254 <hi>D.</hi> The Husband ſeiſed in the right of his Wife in Fee, is outlawed for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, the <hi>King</hi> ſeiſeth, the Husband dieth; now ſhall iſſue forth a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em clauſit extremum,</hi> the words of which <hi>Writ</hi> in ſuch caſe are, <hi>Quia</hi> A. <hi>cujus Terr. &amp; Tenement. quae ipſe tenuit de jure &amp; haereditate</hi> N. <hi>uxoris ſuae adhuc ſuperſtitis occaſione ejuſdem Utlagar' in ipſum pro quadam Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia unde indictatus fuit, &amp;c. in Man. Domini</hi> H. <hi>patris noſtri extiterunt, &amp;c.</hi> therefore the <hi>King</hi> had not the iſſues onely, but alſo the Lands: See to the ſame purpoſe the <hi>Regiſter</hi> 292. <hi>b. Stamford</hi>'s <hi>Placita Coronae,</hi> 186, 187. affirms, That Tenant in tail being attainted of Felony, ſhall forfeit his Lands during his life. And he ſaid, that the Eſtate of <hi>Thomas Venables</hi> was in the King without Office not to grant, for that is reſtrained by the Statute of 18 <hi>H.</hi> 6. but it is in him before Office, ſo as he who hath right ought to ſue to the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Petition,</hi> if he will have his Land: yet he conceived, that before the Statute of 18 <hi>H.</hi> 6. the <hi>King</hi> might grant the Land before Office, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by <hi>Thirning,</hi> 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 278. who was before the ſaid Statute: So if the <hi>King</hi>'s Tenant makes a Leaſe for years, the Remainder over to another in Fee, who dieth without Heir; the Remainder is in the <hi>King</hi> without Office, becauſe a common perſon in ſuch caſe cannot enter, but a claim is ſufficient, and therefore it ſhall be in the <hi>King</hi> without Office. As to the pardon, he ſaid, That it doth not extend to this Eſtate, for this is a Freehold, <hi>ergo,</hi> not within the pardon: As if the <hi>King</hi>'s Tenant be attainted of Felony, and the <hi>King</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons him all offences, and all things which he may pardon, theſe words ſhall not go nor extend to Freeholds, but onely unto perſonal matters, and ſuch puniſhments and peins which do concern Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. But it may be objected, That by this pardon, Title of <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and Re-entries for Conditions broken are excepted; and therefore if they had not been excepted, they had been remitted by the pardon; and therefore this pardon ſhall extend to Inheritances and Freeholds: As to that, I ſay, That ſuch Exceptions were not in uſe in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 4. and yet Inheritances and Freeholds were not taken to be within ſuch pardons, and ſuch Exceptions did begin 5 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi> And he ſaid, he had been of Council in ſuch Caſes where it hath been taken, that ſuch pardons did not extend to Freeholds: As an <hi>Abbat</hi> was diſſeiſed, and afterwards during the Diſſeiſin the Abby is diſſolved; the <hi>King</hi> makes ſuch pardon, the ſame doth not transfer the Right of the <hi>King,</hi> and in that Pardon are divers Exceptions of Goods and Chattels in many caſes, and therefore it cannot be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the pardon doth extend to Freeholds. And ſee the ſaid Act of pardon: The <hi>Queen</hi> grants all Goods, Chattels, Debts, Fines, Iſſues, Profits, Amercements, Forfeitures, Sums of Moneys; which word <hi>[Forfeiture]</hi> ſhall be intended of a perſonal Forfeiture, <hi>&amp; non aliter,</hi> for it is coupled with things of ſuch nature. And as to the Traverſe, he ſaid, It did not lie in this Caſe; for the Office is not untrue, but true in ſubſtance, although void in circumſtance: And alſo the <hi>King</hi> here is entituled by double matter of Record, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the Attainder and the Office: and he ſaid that the Statutes of 34 and 36 <hi>E.</hi> 3. which gave Traverſe, are to be intended of Offices found <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Officii,</hi> and not <hi>virtute Brevis,</hi> for then <hi>Efcheators</hi> were very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome: And the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. doth not give Traverſe, but where the Office is untruly found; as if Tenant of the <hi>King</hi> be diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Diſſeiſor be attainted; the <hi>Queen</hi> ſeiſeth the Land: Now the Diſſeiſee hath not remedy by Traverſe upon the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. but is put to his <hi>Monſtrans de Droit,</hi> for the Office is true: But if I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61358:68"/>
be Tenant of the <hi>King,</hi> and ſeiſed of Land accordingly, and it was found that <hi>J. S.</hi> was ſeiſed of my Land, and attainted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas in truth he had not any thing in my Land, there Traverſe lieth, for the Office is falſe; and ſo in our Caſe, for the Traverſe it is at the Common Law: and it was true that <hi>Venables</hi> was ſeiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coke</hi> to the contrary; and he ſaid, That by the Attainder the <hi>Queen</hi> hath gained but a Chattel; and that notwithſtanding this Forfeiture, if <hi>Venables</hi> had been in poſſeſſion, a <hi>Praecipe</hi> ſhould be brought againſt him: And where it hath been ſaid by Mr. Attorney, That <hi>Writs</hi> ſet down in the Regiſter are the beſt Expoſitours of our Law, the ſame is not ſo; for the Regiſter ſaith, That Waſte lieth notwithſtanding a Meſn Remainder, which is not now Law, but it hath been clearly ruled to the contrary: and ſee accordingly 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Regiſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and the <hi>Writs</hi> are ſubject to the Iudgment of our Law; and the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Diem clauſit extremum</hi> is not to the contrary; for I confeſs, that in ſuch caſe the Land ſhall be ſeiſed into the hands of the <hi>King,</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> ſhall not have but a Chattel therein: It hath been argued, It may be granted,<note place="margin">Roll. Tit. Grant. 4 Len. 112. ac.

A woman Inheretrix taketh a Husband, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is attainted of Felony, the <hi>King</hi> pardons him, they have iſſue, the Husband ſhall be Tenant by the curteſie, which proveth, that the <hi>King</hi> hath not the Freehold by that Attainder. Before the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. Tenant in tail, <hi>poſt prolem ſuſcitatam,</hi> might forfeit his Lands, but now the <hi>Statute</hi> hath ſo incorporated the Eſtate tail to the Tenant in tail, that it cannot be deveſted, even a Fine levied by him <hi>ipſo jure nullus,</hi> although as to the poſſeſſion it be a Diſcontinuance; and that is the reaſon wherefore Tenant in tail ſhall not be ſeiſed to another's uſe. See <hi>Stamford</hi> 190. The Husband ſeiſed in the right of his Wife is attainted of Felony, the <hi>King</hi> ſhall have the profits of the Lands of the Wife during the life of the Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So if Tenant in tail be attainted of Felony, and that is but a Chattel in the Lands of the Wife, and alſo in the Lands of the Tenant in tail: and if the poſſeſſions of a Biſhop be ſeiſed into the <hi>Queen</hi>'s hands for a Contempt, in ſuch caſe the <hi>Queen</hi> hath the poſſeſſion, and not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits onely: the ſame Law of the Lands of Tenant in tail, or for life, being attainted of Felony: ſo of ſeiſure for Alienation without licenſe, or of the poſſeſſions of Priors, Aliens. See <hi>Brook</hi> Reſeiſer 10. So where the Seiſure is for Ideocy. And he ſaid, That in the principal Caſe nothing is in the <hi>King</hi> until Office: and as to the Caſe of 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 6. he confeſſed the ſame; for at that time many, and amongſt them Lawyers and Iuſtices, were attainted by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſo was Sir <hi>John Salisbury,</hi> whoſe Caſe it was; and their Lands by <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> given expreſly to the <hi>King:</hi> and therefore I grant that their Lands were in the <hi>King</hi> before Office. Tenant in Fee of a common Lord is attainted of Felony, his Lands remain in him during his life until the Entry of the Lord, and where the <hi>King</hi> is Lord untill Office be found: but in the Caſe of a common perſon, after the death of the perſon attainted, they are in the Lord before Entry, and in the Caſe of the <hi>King</hi> before Office, for the miſchief of abeyances. And ſee the Lord <hi>Lovel</hi>'s Caſe, 17 and 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 485, 486. <hi>Plow.</hi> where it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, That upon Attainder of Treaſon by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> the Lands were not in the <hi>King</hi> without Office in the life of the party attainted, upon the words of the Act, <hi>ſhall forfeit.</hi> See <hi>Stamford Prerogat.</hi> 54, 55. <hi>acc.</hi> He ſaid, That this intereſt which came unto the <hi>King</hi> by this Attainder, is but a Chattel, and then it is remitted by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and ſo he conceived, if it be a Freehold: For the words of the

general Pardon are large and liberal, <hi>[Pardon and releaſe all manner of Treaſons, &amp;c. and all other things, Cauſes, &amp;c.]</hi> and here <hi>Forfeitures</hi> are pardoned; and this word <hi>[things]</hi> is a tranſcendent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a general word, yet by the direction of the Act of general Pardon it ought to be beneficially expounded and extended, as if all things had been ſpecially ſet down: Alſo the words are, <hi>[Pardon them and their Heirs,]</hi> therefore the Pardon extends to Inheritance, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there is no uſe of that: And he conceived, That by the firſt branch of this Act, that the ſame extends to Inheritances, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Lands of all incumbrances, for every Offence not excepted, for there is the word <hi>[Heirs,]</hi> and the third branch concerns onely Chattels, and that is by the word <hi>[Grant,]</hi> where the firſt is by words of acquittal: See 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>br.

A Leaſe for years upon condition, to ſcowre the Ditches, if the Leſſee ſcowreth them once, it is well enough: And as to this word <hi>Proviſo,</hi> It is to ſee, If here it be a word conditional: In ſome Caſes, this word <hi>Pro,</hi> makes a Condition, as 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8. Grant of a Ward, <hi>pro bono ſervitio,</hi> if the Grantee departeth out of his ſervice, the Grant is void: So if an Annuity be granted unto a Phyſician <hi>pro conſilio impendendo,</hi> the ſame is a Condition, 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 6. For the Grantor hath not means to compell the Grantee to give his Council; but in ſome Caſes, this word <hi>Pro,</hi> doth not make a Condition: As if before the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 3. Land was given <hi>pro homagio ſuo,</hi> there, if the Homage be not done, the Feoffor could not re-enter, but he ought to diſtrain. And I conceive, that in our Caſe, <hi>Proviſo</hi> doth not make a Condition. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 44.

Grant of a Manor, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that it ſhall not extend to wood growing upon the Manor, the ſame is an Exception, not a Condition. See the Biſhop of <hi>York</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Eliz.

The ſaid Biſhop made a Leaſe for certain years of certain Lands, <hi>Proviſo, quod tempore vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> the Rent ſhall be paid to the <hi>Chapter,</hi> It was holden that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> was not a Condition. And here in this Caſe, the Will of <hi>George Scott</hi> was, That the Recoverors ſhould make to the ſaid <hi>Hugh,</hi> a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Leaſe, which cannot be, if it be a conditional Leaſe: Another point was; becauſe the Rent is not well demanded; for he hath demanded the whole Rent of the year, whereas but half a years Rent was onely due. <hi>Coke,</hi> contrary: where the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is parcel of one ſentence which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Covenant, or abridgeth the Covenant, there it ſhall not amount to a Condition, but to an Exception, as a Grant of a Rent-charge,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61358:69"/>
                     <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that he ſhall not charge the perſon, abridgeth the force of the Grant: ſo a Leaſe without impeachment of Waſt, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that the Feoffee ſhall not do voluntary Waſt, the ſame abridgeth the liberty; But in our Caſe, this <hi>Proviſo</hi> makes a Condition, and not a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſentence, or of any Covenant contained in the ſentence, nor doth it participate altogether with the ſentence, but ſtands ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantively, for it was a full ſentence before: A Feoffment in Fee with Warranty, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that when he is impleaded, he ſhall not vouch <hi>J.

And he ſaid, That by the deviſe, <hi>Hugh Scott</hi> had a Leaſe without any Leaſe to be made by the Recoverors. As unto the demand of the whole Rent, where but half a years Rent was due, the ſame is good enough. And ſo was it adjudged in a Caſe betwixt <hi>Andrew</hi>'s and the Lord <hi>Cromwell;</hi> for he is at his peril to pay the one moyety, and in as much as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the whole, he denieth every part.

And the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry found, That the third half year before the tender mentioned before, the Leſſor commanded the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> to receive the Rent then due, who did accordingly, and that the next half year then following, the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> did receive the ſaid Rent, without commandment of the Leſſor, but after the Leſſor agreed unto it, and that the immediate half year before this tender in queſtion, the Defendant paid the Rent then due, to the Leſſor himſelf, who received it, And it was the opinion of <hi>Wray,</hi> chief Iuſtice, that this tender was good, and it is not like unto the caſe of an Obligation; for there the Obligee cannot have an Action of Debt before the laſt day: but here the Leſſor might have diſtrained, or have had an Action of Debt before the Month expired, and ſo the Leſſor is bound by this tender; and by <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Iuſtice, This tender cannot be ſaid a tender by a ſtranger, for here <hi>Mary</hi> came in privity of the ſervant of the Leſſee, and as it is found by Verdict, <hi>Mary</hi> tendered it to the Leſſor, as being requeſted by the ſervant of the Leſſee: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon conſideration had betwixt the Iuſtices themſelves; the Iuſtices, <hi>viz.

                  <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> by <hi>Moore</hi> againſt <hi>Savil,</hi> the Caſe was, That Tenant in tail leaſed the Land to the father, mother and ſon for their lives, by Indenture, in which it was comprehended, That foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Leſſor is but Tenant in tail, and ſo cannot by Law limit theſe Eſtates by way of Remainder, but jointly in poſſeſſion; and his intent was, That becauſe this Leaſe was procured and obtained at the ſpecial ſuit, and coſts and charges of the father, That the ſaid ſon ſhould ſuffer his father, and after him his mother, to take the profits of the ſaid Lands demiſed, and to occupy and hold the ſaid Lands to their onely profit without interruption of the ſaid ſon, notwithſtanding his joint Eſtate in poſſeſſion with them, <hi>Proviſum igitur eſt,</hi> That if the ſaid ſon ſhall challenge, claim, demand or take any profits of the Lands ſo demiſed, or enter into the ſame, during the life of his ſaid father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That then the Eſtate to him limited by the ſaid Indenture ſhould ceaſe, and be utterly void. And it was the clear opinion of the whole Court, That this <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Proviſo</hi> was utterly void, for it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Eſtate limited before; as in the Caſe cited by <hi>Coke</hi> at the Bar.

                  <p>
                     <hi>HEnry</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> exhibited a Bill in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> againſt <hi>Roger Townſend,</hi> Eſquire, for that the ſaid <hi>Roger Townſend,</hi> in an Action betwixt <hi>James Taverner</hi> Plaintiff, and <hi>James Cromwel</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, of the ſaid Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> Defendant, in Treſpaſs, in the favour and unlawfull maintenance of the ſaid <hi>Taverner,</hi> did procure a partial Iury to be retorned. And upon the hearing of the Cauſe, the matter given in Evidence was, That the ſaid <hi>Taverner</hi> was a Copiholder of the ſaid Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and that the ſaid Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> pretending that the ſaid <hi>Taverner</hi> had forfeited his Copihold, cauſed the ſaid <hi>James Cromwel</hi> to make an Entry, in the right of the ſaid Lord, upon the ſaid <hi>Taverner;</hi> upon which Entry, <hi>Taverner</hi> brought an Action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt the ſaid <hi>James Cromwel,</hi> in which Action the parties were at Iſſue upon the forfeiture. And before any <hi>Venire facias</hi> iſſued forth, <hi>Taverner</hi> hearing that one <hi>Steward,</hi> who was Bailiff of the Franchize, under the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and who ought to make the Pannel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was purpoſed to have made the ſaid Pannel not duly; <hi>viz.</hi> to retorn therein, great Gentlemen of the County, who were Lords of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, in favour of the ſaid Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> went unto the ſaid <hi>Roger Townſend,</hi> who was then one of the principal ſervants and agents of the ſaid Earl, and ſhewed to him, that if thoſe great perſons and Lords of Manors be retorned for the trial of that Iſſue, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they would not ſo eaſily appear for the expedition of the parties, as people of leſſer condition; and alſo many of them being Lords of Manors, and having cuſtomary Tenants, and therefore not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to try that Iſſue, and prayed his Order to the ſaid <hi>Steward,</hi> for the making of an indifferent Pannel; where, upon a conference with the ſaid <hi>Steward</hi> for the making of an indifferent Pannel, and ſhewing to him, the making of the ſaid Pannel was not convenient, or any equal courſe to retorn Knights, Eſquires or Lords of Manors, but rather ſuch ſufficient perſons, for the greater expedition of Iuſtice, and indifferency of the trial; And afterwards the ſaid <hi>Taverner</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a Petition, ſhewing all the ſpecial matter, and praying him to give Order for the making of an indifferent Pannel for the trial of that Cauſe, which Petition was delivered to the ſaid Earl by the ſaid <hi>Townſend,</hi> in the name of the ſaid <hi>Taverner.</hi> Vpon which the Earl did refer the ſaid matter to three of his chiefeſt agents and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, <hi>i. Dickſey, Townſend</hi> and <hi>Carrel,</hi> and delivered to them the Book of Freeholders within the ſaid Franchiſe, who, according to their Commiſſion made a Pannel, which was retorned; and the Iury paſſed with the ſaid <hi>James Cromwel</hi> in the right of the ſaid Lord: And if this intermedling of <hi>Townſend</hi> with this matter, as aboveſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially his conference with the Bailiff, be maintenance or not, was the Queſtion. And by the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wray,</hi> chief Iuſtices, It was delivered for Law, That becauſe the ſaid <hi>Townſend</hi> was in manner a ſervant of the ſaid Earl, who had retorn of <hi>Writs,</hi> and one of his principal Counſellours and agents, and hearing, <hi>Ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuatione,</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Taverner,</hi> the misdemeanour of the Bailiff of his Lord could not do better, than to ſhew to the Bailiff his duty, for it concerned the honour of his Lord, and alſo his Inheritance in the Franchiſe; But if the ſaid <hi>Townſend</hi> had been a mere ſtranger to the ſaid Earl, ſo as no ſuch privity had been betwixt them, it had been clearly maintenance in <hi>Townſend;</hi> as it was lately adjudged in this Court, in the Caſe of one <hi>Gifford;</hi>

wrote to one of the Iurors who was retorned in the Pannel, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to appear at the day, and to doe in the Cauſe according to his Conſcience; and that was adjudged <hi>Maintenance.</hi> And afterwards, upon the full hearing of the cauſe, the ſaid <hi>Townſend,</hi> by the ſentence of the ſaid Court, was acquitted of every <hi>Maintenance,</hi> with great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance and approbation of many Lords of the <hi>Council</hi> there preſent: <hi>Bromley Cancellario tantum exclamante.</hi>

Poph. 25. 1 Roll 215.</note>THE Caſe was this; The <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen, Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> leaſed for ſeventy years for certain Rent payable at the Feaſts of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Annunciation; Proviſo,</hi> that if the Rent be behind, and not paid by the ſpace of forty days after any of the Feaſts aforeſaid, that the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe and be void. At <hi>Mich.</hi> 9 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Rent was not paid according to the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> but a Month after the ſaid forty days it was paid, and Acquittance given for it; and ſo the Rents due after unto 30 <hi>Eliz.</hi> were duly paid, and Acquittances given for the ſame. The <hi>Queen</hi> gave and granted the Reverſion in Fee to Sir <hi>Thomas Henage, &amp;c.</hi> and after it was found by Office that the Rent was arrear, <hi>ut ſupra:</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Henage</hi> entred, and leaſed for years to Sir <hi>Moil Finch,</hi> who being ejected, brought a <hi>Quo minus</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an <hi>Ejectione Firmae, &amp;c.</hi> It was argued by <hi>Coke,</hi> That this Leaſe upon the matter aforeſaid is avoidable by the Patentee, and that without Office; for the concluſion of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is not, that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhall re-enter, but that the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe and be void: and the <hi>Queen</hi> is not driven to demand her Rent, as in ſuch caſe a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is tied. And he compared it to the Caſe of a common perſon; If a common perſon leaſeth for years, upon condition, that if the Leſſee doth not build upon the Land demiſed a Houſe within a year after, that the Leaſe ſhall be void, and afterwards grants the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to a ſtranger: the Grantee ſhall have advantage of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, be it broken before or after the Grant; for the Leaſe in ſuch caſe is void, not onely voidable; and the reaſon is, becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is collateral: which ſee 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. A Leaſe for years is made upon Condition, that if the Leſſee doth not go to <hi>Rome</hi> before ſuch a day, that the Leaſe ſhall be void; the Leſſor grants the Reverſion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Leſſee attorns, and doth not go to <hi>Rome</hi> within the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the Grantee may re-enter; contrary, if the concluſion of the Condition had been by way of re-entry, for then it ſhould run in privity by the Common Law: But where a Leaſe with ſuch Condition was made for life, with this concluſion of the Condition, that the Leaſe ſhall be void, the Grantee ſhall not take advantage of that by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, for there the Eſtate is not void untill re-entry, for there is a Freehold which ought to be avoided by Entry: But in our Caſe the Condition is upon the matter collateral, for no demand is requiſite to take advantage of the Condition. And he ſaid it is a general Rule, where in the Caſe of a common perſon an Eſtate may be deveſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Entry, there in the Caſe of the <hi>Queen</hi> there needs not any Office; but here in our Caſe, if it had been a Caſe of a common perſon, the Eſtate ſhould be deveſted without Entry, therefore in the Caſe of the <hi>Queen</hi> without Office: See <hi>Stamford</hi> for the <hi>Major Propoſition</hi> 55. but it doth not veſt to have Treſpaſs before Entry: and he vouched the Caſe of <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton, Plow.</hi> 136. where ſuch Leaſe after ſuch Condition broken, is merely void and diſſolved. And he ſaid, That it was the Opinion of the Iuſtices of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> now late,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61358:72"/>
That by a Releaſe to ſuch Leſſee, after the condition broken, <hi>nihil ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur;</hi> for after the Condition broken he is but Tenant at ſufferance; and a Leaſe for years, being but a Cattel, may begin without cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and end without ceremony: 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. If the <hi>King</hi> make a Leaſe for years, with clauſe of Re-entry for not payment of the Rent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Rent be behind, yet the <hi>King</hi> ſhall not re-enter before Office found; and there ought to be a Seiſure, for the Leaſe is not void by the non-payment of the Rent, but onely voidable: but if the Leaſe be void for not payment, as in our caſe it is, to what purpoſe ſhall an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be? for by the mere contract the Leaſe ceaſeth, without re-entry, or without Office: But admit that the Leaſe ſhall not ceaſe without Office, and before Office the <hi>Queen</hi> grants the Reverſion over, yet an Office found after the Grant ſhall avoid the Leaſe as well as if it had been found before the Grant. A Leaſe is made upon condition, that if the Leſſor build a Houſe upon the Land leaſed, and pay to the Leſſee 20<hi>l.</hi> that then the Leaſe ſhall be void; the Leſſor builds the Houſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards grants the Reverſion, the Grantee pays the 20 <hi>l.</hi> now the Leaſe is void, although the Condition be partly performed in the time of the Leſſor, and partly in the time of the Grantee. So here, although the Grant of the <hi>Queen</hi> be Meſn between the non-payment of the Rent, and the Office; for the <hi>Queen</hi> is not entitled by the Office to the Land, but by the Condition broken, and the Office is onely to inform the <hi>Queen</hi> of her Title; and when the Office is once found, it ſhall relate unto the time of the Condition broken, and ſhall be of ſuch force as if then it had been found:<note place="margin">H. 3. H. 7. f. 3.

The <hi>King</hi> ſeiſed of a Rent which is arrear, grants the ſaid Rent, the arrearages ſhall not paſs: So here of the mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, for they are flowers faln from the ſtalk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Godfrey</hi> contrary; and he ſaid, That the Leaſe is in being not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by the Condition, or the Office: and he ſaid, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the words of the Leaſe are, <hi>That the Leaſe ſhall be void,</hi> yet before that an Office be found, the Leaſe ſhall not be avoided: In all caſes where the <hi>Queen</hi> is entitled to any thing, or to defeat the Eſtate of another, an Office is neceſſary; and that ground is taken in the caſe of the Lord <hi>Berkley, Plow. Com.</hi> 229. by <hi>Brown,</hi> therefore here, it ought to be found by Office: See alſo the caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Fitz. Abridg. Forfeiture</hi> 18. 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. The Biſhop leaſed for life certain Lands given by the Progenitors of the <hi>King,</hi> as parcel of the Barony of the Biſhoprick, rendring 30<hi>l</hi> Rent; and afterwards, by aſſent of the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> releaſed a great part of the ſaid Rent; the Leaſe and the Rent ought to be found by Office. So an Alienation in <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> ought to be found by Office, becauſe the intereſt of another is to be defeated: So where the <hi>King</hi>'s Tenant ceaſeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Villein of the <hi>King</hi> purchaſeth Lands, or but a Leaſe for years: So where the <hi>King</hi> is but to have <hi>annum, diem &amp; vaſtum,</hi> Waſte committed by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the <hi>King:</hi> Leſſee of the <hi>King</hi> for years makes a Feoffment in Fee; in all theſe caſes the <hi>King,</hi> without Office, ſhall not be entitled. The ſame Law is in caſe of a Condition broken; which ſee 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>Plow.</hi> 213. <hi>Frowick</hi> in his <hi>Reading</hi> puts this caſe: A Subject leaſeth for years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, which is afterwards broken, and afterwards the Leſſor becomes King, here needs no Office, for at the time of the breach of the Condition the Leſſor was not King.<note place="margin">Forbiſher and Bunny's Caſe.</note> The Caſe betwixt Sir <hi>Martin Forbiſher</hi> and one <hi>Bunny</hi> was, that the <hi>Queen</hi> made a Leaſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61358:73"/>
of <hi>Dutchy</hi> Land upon Condition, which was broken: It was holden, that here there needs not any Office, for the <hi>Queen</hi> had thoſe Lands ſevered from the Crown by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and they paſſed by the <hi>Dutchy</hi> Seal by Livery, and attornment of the Tenants: The <hi>Queen</hi> leaſeth for years, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that the Leſſee ſhall not alien; ſuch alienation againſt ſuch a Condition ought to be found by Office: and therefore at this day, where a Forfeiture is given to the <hi>King, &amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Statute,</hi> the words are, <hi>That the King ſhall be ſeiſed without Office:</hi> And as to the Relation of an Office, he ſaid, That an Office may have a Relation as to mean profits, but not as to veſt the intereſt from the time of the Title accrued. And although that in the Grant of the <hi>Queen</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Henage</hi> there be theſe words, <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> the not finding any Office, yet in this caſe an Office is neceſſary, for the <hi>Queen</hi> cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the Law, ſo to alter or change the Law, as to make Lands in <hi>Borough-Engliſh</hi> deſcendable at the common Law: So if the <hi>King</hi> make a Leaſe for years, with clauſe of re-entry, and afterwards grants the Reverſion over to a Subject; and farther grants, that if the Rent be behind, that the Leſſor may re-enter without demand; yet the Grantee ought to demand the Rent. And, as our caſe is here, there needs not any Office to entitle the <hi>Queen</hi> to the Mean profits; for although that the Rent was not paid at the day, yet it was paid after, and all Rent due afterwards, and Acquittances given for the ſame; which matter we have ſpecially pleaded to the intent aforeſaid, upon which the other ſide have demurred, and thereby have confeſſed it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Office doth not give any intereſt to the <hi>Queen</hi> in the thing leaſed, for ſhe hath granted them over before, by which ſhe hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled her ſelf to take advantage of the Condition aforeſaid, for ſhe hath ſurceaſed her time: 8 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>Traverſe</hi> 47. Tenant for life forfeits his Eſtate, and before the <hi>King</hi> ſeiſeth, The Tenant for life dieth, he in the Reverſion may enter, and the <hi>King</hi> ſhall not ſeiſe, for the <hi>King</hi> hath ſurceaſed his time. And if the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould have advantage of this Condition, ſhe ſhould avoid her own Grant, which ſhould be a great inconvenience; The <hi>Queen</hi> leaſeth for years, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that the Leſſee ſhall not do Waſte; the <hi>Queen</hi> grants over the Reverſion after Waſte done, Office is found, the <hi>Queen</hi> gains nothing by it. It was agreed in the Caſe betwixt <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Beech,</hi> 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> That the Grant of the <hi>Queen</hi> Meſn between the award of the Commiſſion, and the Retorn of it was good; for the Title of the <hi>Queen</hi> appeareth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, although that the Commiſſion was not retorned before the Grant made: And if an Office ſhould relate unto the time of the Condition broken, it ſhould be in vain to argue that point: for in the ſaid caſe it was holden a Record, when the Iurors had put their Seals to it, before that it be enrolled: The acceptance of the Rent, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances thereof are pleaded, 1. To prove, that there is no cauſe to find an Office in this caſe, for the <hi>Queen</hi> is anſwered the Mean profits: 2. To prove, that the <hi>Queen</hi> hath waved and refuſed to take the benefit of the Condition, but not to conclude the <hi>Queen,</hi> and then you cannot force her to take the benefit of the Condition: As the <hi>King,</hi> Lord, and Tenant, the Tenant dieth, his Heir within age, the <hi>King</hi> accepteth of the Services of the Heir, and afterwards grants over the Seignory, after Office is found, the <hi>King</hi> ſhall not have the Wardſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At another day it was argued by <hi>Popham,</hi> Attorny General, for the Plaintiff; and he ſaid, That upon not payment of the Rent, the Leaſe is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void, without any Office found thereof, and that by reaſon of theſe words, <hi>[ſhall not be void;]</hi> for he ſaid, it is not a Condition, but rather a limitation: As if the <hi>King</hi> make a Leaſe to three for eighty years, <hi>ſi tam diu vixerint,</hi> one of them dieth, the Leaſe is determined without Office: So a Leaſe made vy the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61358:73"/>
                     <hi>Queen</hi> for years, ſo long as the Leſſee ſhall pay the Rent reſerved, or ſo long as the Leſſee ſhall there inhabit: In theſe caſes, upon a Leaſe made by a common perſon, the Leſſor before Entry might grant over, and the Grantee ſhall have advantage of it, for it is a limitation, and by the limitation the Leaſe is determined before the Grant; contrary, if it had been by words of re-entry. A Leaſe for ſixty years, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if the Leſſee ſhall die within the term, that the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe; the Leſſor grants the Reverſion over, the Grantee ſhall take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereof by the common Law: See the Caſe 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. it is a limitation, and not a Condition. And he ſaid, in this caſe an Office is neceſſary, not to avoid the Leaſe, for that was void before; nor to puniſh the Leſſee as a Treſpaſſor, or to fine him for the continuance of his wrongfull poſſeſſion; but to make him reſponſable as an Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. In the Leaſe of a common perſon, where the clauſe is, That the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe; If after the Rent behind, the Leſſee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his poſſeſſion, yet the Leſſor ſhall not puniſh the Leſſee as a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſor before his Entry, for the Leſſee by his continuance is but Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at ſufferance, for his firſt Entry was lawfull; And he agreed the Books, 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. That ſuch advantages that a common perſon cannot have without Entry, the <hi>Queen</hi> cannot have without Office: But a common perſon before Entry cannot puniſh another by way of Treſpaſs, therefore neither the <hi>Queen,</hi> without Office, ſhall puniſh one as an Intruder: And as to the Caſe, now lately adjudged betwixt <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Beech,</hi> the ſame doth not extend to our Caſe;<note place="margin">Knight and Beech's caſe.</note> for there an Office was requiſite before the Grant of the <hi>Queen,</hi> becauſe the <hi>per</hi>-cloſe of the Condition was, That the Prior ſhould re-enter: and it is very clear, That Chattels veſt in the <hi>Queen</hi> without Office. And in this Caſe an Office is neceſſary for two purpoſes: 1. To make the Grant good: 2. To make the Occupier accountable for the Mean profits, and to give recompence, which the <hi>Queen</hi> is not enabled unto without Office. And here the Patentee ſhall have advantage of the ceſſer of this Leaſe: For, 1. He hath the Inheritance lawfully: and 2. The Leaſe is determined. If there were no <hi>Non obſtante</hi> in the <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> the ſaid Leaſe ought to have been recited, if it had not been determined; and if it be determined (as this caſe is) it ought to be recited, if there were not a <hi>Non obſtante;</hi> for <hi>non conſtat</hi> to the <hi>Queen,</hi> if it be determined or not: And he ſaid, That Leaſes which are of Record, are to be recited in <hi>Patents</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> but not thoſe which are not of Record, for Leaſes on Record may be eaſily found, but contrary of Leaſes in <hi>Fait:</hi> but in our caſe all is helped by the <hi>Non obſtante;</hi> for the words of the <hi>Letters Patents</hi> are, <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> That no office be thereof found, miſrecital or non-recital of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Leaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It hath been objected, That becauſe that the Law of the Land is, That in Grants of the <hi>King,</hi> all former Eſtates ought to be recited, the <hi>Non obſtante</hi> of the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhall not help it: To that he ſaid, That where the Law makes for the <hi>Queen,</hi> there the <hi>Queen</hi> for a particular reſpect may diſpenſe with the Law. If the <hi>Queen</hi> be deceived by the not recital, that makes the <hi>Letters Patents</hi> naught; but if the <hi>Queen</hi> be not deceived by the not recital, the ſame ſhall not hurt. And it is clear, That the <hi>Queen</hi> may diſpenſe with a <hi>Statute Law,</hi> although perhaps not with the common Law; The <hi>Queen</hi> grants upon ſuggeſtion, if the ſuggeſtion be falſe, the Patent is void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Queen</hi> is deceived in her Grant: and if the ſuggeſtion reſt in Articles, and ſome of the Articles be falſe, the <hi>Patent</hi> for that is void: but if in the <hi>Patent</hi> ſuch clauſe be, <hi>That be the ſuggeſtion true or falſe,</hi> the <hi>Patent</hi> ſhall be good: If the <hi>King</hi> ſeiſed of a Manor, to which an <hi>Advowſon</hi> is appendant, grant the Manor, <hi>cum pertinentii<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſaid, That the Office here is not neceſſary to determine the Leaſe, but to enable the <hi>Queen</hi> to puniſh the Leſſee for the continuance of his poſſeſſion: And if the concluſion of the Condition had been by way of re-entry for non-payment of the Rent, and after the Rent is behind, and afterwards the <hi>Queen</hi> accepts the Rent due after, the <hi>Queen</hi> is not bounden by that, but upon an Office found ſhe ſhall avoid the Leaſe.</p>

be found by Office: When the <hi>Queen</hi> hath after received the Rent, and granted over the Reverſion, now the Forfeiture is purged, not by way of concluſion, but it amounts to as much as if the <hi>Queen</hi> had ſaid, That ſhe would not take benefit of it: 4 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Champernoun</hi>'s Caſe: The <hi>King,</hi> by taking in Ward of the Heir of the Donee, hath waved the Heir of the Donor: See <hi>Plow.</hi> in the Lord <hi>Barkley</hi>'s Caſe, 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 237. and <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 143. And here in our Caſe, when the <hi>Queen</hi> grants over the Reverſion, here the whole uſe of an Office is gone; for no Office ſhall be found for the benefit of a Subject: and as to the <hi>Queen,</hi> no benefit ſhall accrue unto her by ſuch Office, for if ſhe by ſuch Office ſhall be entituled to the poſſeſſion, ſhe ſhould avoid her own Grant of the Reverſion; for ſhe ought to have as great an Eſtate by the breach of the Condition, as ſhe had at the time of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And in this Caſe the Office comes too late for the <hi>Queen, &amp;c.</hi> as in the Lord <hi>Lovel</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Plow.</hi> 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 482. A Leaſe for years is made unto an Alien, upon condition, that if the Alien pay ſuch a ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Leſſor at any time during the Leaſe, that he ſhall have Fee; the Alien is made a Denizen, the Money is paid, and all that is found by Office: The <hi>Queen</hi> ſhall not have the Fee, for at the time of the veſting of the Fee the Leſſe was Denizen; and the Office ſhall not relate to the time when the Fee veſts, and no farther, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void incumbrances: and ſo in ſuch Caſe the Office comes too late. And if the <hi>King</hi>'s Villain purchaſeth Lands, and the <hi>King</hi> make him free, and afterwards Office is found, the ſame ſhall not entitle the <hi>King,</hi> but the Villain manumitted ſhall hold the Land: So in our Caſe, the <hi>Queen</hi> after this Grant ſhall not take the benefit of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or breach of the Condition found by it.</p>
                  <p>And afterwards, <hi>Manwood,</hi> chief Baron, gave order, That thoſe who do argue after, ſhall ſpeak but to two points:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where the Queen Leaſes for years, rendring Rent payable at the Receipt at <hi>Weſt.</hi> in which Leaſe there is a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That if the Rent be behind, the Leaſe ſhall be void, If now the Rent not being paid, the Leaſe ſhall be void without any Office?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To what effect an Office now ſhall be, being found after the <hi>Queen</hi> hath granted the Inheritance over.</p>
                  <p>At another day, <hi>Owen,</hi> Serjeant, argued to the contrary; and he ſaid, the Leaſe is void without any Office: for as a Leaſe for years may be made by contract, ſo it may be avoided by words of contract, otherwiſe it is of Freehold; So that a Leaſe ſhall be avoided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entry, 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. 137, 138. <hi>Plow. Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton</hi>'s Caſe; Offices are of two ſorts: Firſt, entituling the <hi>Queen,</hi> as purchaſe of an Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, purchaſe of Villain, alienation in <hi>Mortmain;</hi> and Offices infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>Queen,</hi> where ſhe hath intereſt in the Land before, as in our Caſe here: Admit that the Office was neceſſary to find the breach of the Condition; the Patentee ſhall take the benefit of it: for being found by Office, that the <hi>Queen</hi> hath made ſuch a Leaſe with conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be void for non-payment of Rent, and that at ſuch a day the Rent was behind, now, being of Record, every Subject ſhall take advantage of it: As where a Husband makes a Feoffment in Fee upon condition, of the Land of his Wife, and dieth; If the Heir en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Condition broken, now may the Wife enter upon him; for now the diſcontinuance is avoided: See 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. Where the Grantee of the Reverſion ſhall take advantage of a condition, <hi>ut ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra,</hi> concluding, That the Leaſe ſhall be void: And ſee 136. <hi>Plowd. Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton</hi>'s Caſe. And although after the default of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Rent due afterwards was accepted, yet that ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Queen;</hi> for this acceptance is not under the great Seal, but onely done by the Office: Alſo the Leaſe being void, for the non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be made good by acceptance afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61358:75"/>
                     <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> contrary, Although that the Leaſe be void, <hi>de facto,</hi> yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it appeareth to the Court, the Court cannot ſay it is void, or not void: therefore Office is neceſſary to aſcertain the Court: The Queen is a body Politick, and the chief body Politick above others, becauſe ſhe is the Maker, Authour and Creatour of all other Corporations; and that is the reaſon, that the King cannot ſpeak without writing; and this is the moſt ſolemn writing: <hi>i.</hi> Writing of Record; So ſhe cannot take but by Record: And in our Caſe, it doth not appear by any writing of Record, the Rent was behind; and it is agreeable to the Majeſty of a King to do nothing without matter of Record; which ſee 4 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the caſe of the Dutchy: And he ſaid there is no difference betwixt the Caſe in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and our Caſe: In each Caſe it is a Leaſe for years, Rent reſerved, in this onely differing, that there is a clauſe of re-entry; and here the concluſion of the Condition is that the Leaſe ſhall be void; but in both Caſes, none can ſay that the Rent is behind, untill it be found by Office, therefore none can ſay, that the Leaſe is void, untill Office found: See by <hi>Thorp,</hi> 35 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Chattels perſonals of the <hi>King</hi>'s Villains, are in the <hi>King</hi> without office, for ſuch things may be loſt or worn, contrary of Chattels Reals, as a Leaſe for years; for Land can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but continue: and ſuch things which may be in the <hi>King</hi> without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he may grant without writing, as a chain of Gold, or a Horſe, Deodands, Felons goods, Wreck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> veſt without Office, becauſe Chattels perſonals: See 20 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 11. contrary, when they are Chattels reals, and permanent; for there an Office is neceſſary: In the Caſe of year, day and waſte, an Office ought to be found, <hi>Ergo, à multo fortiori,</hi> in caſe of a Leaſe for years, which is a greater intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 49 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 11. There is a general Rule, <hi>Quo modo quodque ligatur, eo modo diſſolvitur:</hi> That which paſſeth by Livery ought to be reduced by re-entry, that which begins by Record, ought to be determined by Record; and here in our Caſe, the Land cannot depart from the <hi>King</hi> without Record, therefore it ſhall not revert without Record; although that the breach of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be but matter of fact, yet the proof of that ought to be of Record: And here in our Caſe, is a condition, and not a limitation. And he ſaid, that in the Caſe often cited before of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. it is a limitation, and not a condition; For if it were a condition, the Grantee by the Law could not take advantage of it, becauſe not privy: and he was clear of opinion, that where the words are, That the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe, or ſhall be void; yet in ſuch caſes there ought to be an Office, for in Leaſes of the <hi>King</hi> there needs no re-entry, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> (to ſpeak properly) cannot re-enter. And the words, <hi>[That the Leaſe ſhall be void]</hi> do amount to words of re-entry, and he ſaid, That in the Caſe of a common perſon upon ſuch a condition broken, the Land ſhall not be in the Leſſor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out re-entry, no more ſhall they be here in the Caſe of the <hi>Queen</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Office: Alſo the Rent reſerved upon this Leaſe was behind, and the Leſſee continuing the poſſeſſion, the <hi>Queen</hi> by acceptance of the Rent, hath affirmed the party Tenant, and afterwards granted the Reverſion over before any Office found of that matter; Now the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee is diſcharged, and ſhall never be impeached for the ſaid Rent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and the Grant, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia, &amp;c.</hi> after found, ſhall not defeat this Grant by any relation. And the <hi>Queen</hi> by her Grant hath included all the advantage which accrued unto her by the breach of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as to that which hath been objected, That in the Letters Patents there are theſe words, Notwithſtanding the not finding of any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> truly the ſame makes the matter more clear for us; for by theſe words, it is apparent, that the <hi>Queen</hi> would not have an Office found; &amp; if ſo, then the Land paſſeth as in Reverſion, and the <hi>Queen</hi> may diſpenſe with a thing concerning her ſelf: as of late it was adjudged in the Caſe of one <hi>Michel.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> makes a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent, <hi>Si petatur,</hi> It was holden in ſuch caſe, that the Rent in ſuch caſe,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61358:75"/>
ought to be demanded by the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Officer; and in ſuch caſe the <hi>Queen</hi> may well enough diſpenſe with her Prerogative; and here the <hi>Queen</hi> conceived, that ſhe ſhould not have an Office, nor have her Title found by it. <hi>Manwood,</hi> chief Baron, The <hi>Queen</hi> leaſeth for years upon condition, That if the Leſſee doth not marry within two years, that the Leaſe ſhall be void, whether here there ought to be an Office or not. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> ſaid, That here ought to be an Office.</p>
                  <p>At another day, It was argued again by <hi>Godfrey,</hi> This Leaſe is not void, <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> for the not payment of the Rent, which is but matter in fact: and as this Leaſe hath his beginning by matter of Record, ſo alſo his end ſhall be by matter of Record: In caſes of a common perſon there ought to be a demand, therefore in caſe of the <hi>King</hi> an Office,<note place="margin">Hob. 331. 3 Co.</note> as in the Caſe of a common perſon demand ought to be as well where the Condition is by way of re-entry, as that the Leaſe ſhall be void; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in both Caſes, in the Caſe of the <hi>King</hi> there ſhall be an Office: and he ſaid, That if the Leaſe and the Condition be in the Caſe of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, that the Leaſe ſhall be void, without any demand of that Rent, then there needs no demand; for demand is a part of Contract: and here, before Office found, the Leaſe is not merely void, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe unto the Leſſee before Office, is good; and the <hi>Queen</hi> is not enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to the profits before office found; It was argued by <hi>Coke</hi> to the contrary, The Leaſe is void without any demand, without any Office, for it is parcel of the Contract to be ſo void, and he ſaid, That this Leaſe before Office is void in intereſt and property, but not in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Where a common perſon ſhall not have the Land without Action, the King ſhall not have it without Office, and <hi>Scire facias;</hi> as <hi>Ceſſavit, Waſt. contra formam donationis, &amp;c.</hi> and where a common perſon ſhall not have before Entry, the <hi>King</hi> ſhall not have before Office, for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is in the place of Entry, Wardſhip, Mortmain. It is clear, in the Caſe of a common perſon, That if the Condition be, that the Leaſe ſhall be void without any demand, that there demand is not requiſite, therefore nor in the Caſe of the <hi>King:</hi> See <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton</hi>'s Caſe,<note place="margin">Plowd. Com. 136.</note> That ſuch a Leaſe with ſuch a Condition, after the Rent behind, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made good: And it is a general rule, That where the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the term appears by Record, and the <hi>King</hi> is to have but a Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in it, there the <hi>King</hi> upon matter <hi>in fait</hi> ſhall have it without Office; as the Temporalties of the Biſhop upon his death, which is matter <hi>in fait:</hi> See <hi>F.

The Widow of the <hi>King</hi> marries her ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> ſhall ſeize the Lands, and that without Office, and there the marriage is matter <hi>in fait:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> leaſeth for years upon condition, that if the Leſſee marry, that then the Leaſe ſhall be void, If the Leſſee marry her ſelf, the Leaſe is void without any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and if ſo, then every ſtranger in the world ſhall have advantage of it, as the Caſe is, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. as was the Caſe of <hi>Ralph Thomas;</hi>

And in our Caſe, This Office doth not entitle the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, for how can an Office entitle a common perſon?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Egerton,</hi> Solicitor general, to the ſame intent; And he ſaid, that this Leaſe is altogether void, in privity, property, right and term: In the Caſe of a common perſon, after the Rent behind, in ſuch caſe the Leſſee ſhould be Tenant at ſufferance, which cannot be in the <hi>King</hi>'s Caſe; and if Tenant at ſufferance, then no privity; for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe by the Leſſor to the Leſſee cannot enure, and that for want of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; <hi>Lit.</hi> 109. And ſuch Leſſee cannot attorn, and if the Leſſor after that accepts of the Rent, the ſame doth not make the Leaſe good, and all for want of privity; therefore here is no privity: As to property, ſuch a Leaſe ſhall not be ſaid Aſſets in the hands of an Executor, nor ſhall be ſold upon an Extent, nor forfeited by outlawry; And here in this Caſe, the <hi>Queen</hi> cannot be ſaid to take any thing by the breach of the Condition, but hath her reverſion diſcharged of the Leaſe; and he ſaid, That the Office is found well enough for time, and it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the time when the title accrued, that is, when the Rent was behind, and the arrearages of the Rent do not paſs by the grant of the Land, or the reverſion: The <hi>Queen</hi> hath a Rent-charge out of Lands which is behind, the Lands come to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and ſhe grants the ſame over, yet ſhe ſhall charge the Lands with the ſaid arrearages; but contrary, in caſe of an injury done upon the Land of the <hi>Queen:</hi> As the Tenant of the <hi>King</hi> aliens without licence, and afterwards the Lands ſo aliened came to the <hi>King</hi>'s hands who grants them over; the Grantee, nor the Land ſhall be charged, but onely he who was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the alienation, his Lands, and his Executors; So of an Intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Tenant for life of the <hi>King</hi> makes a Feoffment in Fee, the <hi>King</hi> grants over the reverſion, and afterwards the tortious Feoffment is found by Office; this Office is ſoon enough for time, and the Grantee of the reverſion ſhall have advantage of it, and the <hi>King</hi> the mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from the time of the alienation: and afterward in <hi>Mich.</hi> Term, 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Caſe was argued by the Barons.</p>

Gent,</hi> Baron, argued to the ſame intent: <hi>Manwood,</hi> chief Baron, to the ſame intent. The Rents reſerved upon the Leaſes of the Queen, are to be paid to Receivors, Baileys, or at the Receipt of the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> ſhall not make any demand of her rent, for ſhe hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Farmors, and if demand be neceſſary, ſhe were to ſend an army of Receivors, or Baileys to receive and demand her rents. If the Rent of the King be to be paid at the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> if the <hi>King</hi>'s Fermor be there, and tender the rent at due time, and none be there to receive it, he hath ſaved his Leaſe, for he hath done his poſſible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, although the words of the Condition in the Leaſe be behind and unpaid, yet not tendred, ſhall be underſtood: as in the common caſe of Mortgages and Obligations. But in all the Record before us, there is no words of any tender, therefore, according to the words of the condition, the Leaſe is meerly void, and determined in right, in privity, and in tenure; for ſo is the pleaſure of the Prince expreſſed in her Letters Patents under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> That it ſhall be then void, and of no effect: <hi>Then, i.</hi> whenſoever the Rent ſhall happen to be behind; and therefore as ſoon as the Rent was behind the Leaſe was determined: ſo that if after the non-payment a ſtranger had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon him, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the Leſſee, upon which he brings <hi>Ejectione Firmae,</hi> the Defendant might have pleaded the ſpecial matter againſt him, Iudgment if Action: ſo as the Leaſe is void in Right: It is alſo void in Privity and Tenure; for a Releaſe to ſuch Leſſee, after the Rent is behind, is altogether void; for he was not then Leſſee, and ſo the privity is gone, and no acceptance can make ſuch Leaſe good. And if ſuch a Leſſee after his Rent would ſurrender, and in conſideration of ſuch Surrender obtain a new Leaſe from the <hi>Queen,</hi> this new Leaſe is alſo void, for here upon the matter is no ſurrender: Alſo ſuch a Leaſe is void in property; for if the Leſſee in ſuch caſe dieth, his intereſt, ſuch as it is, ſhall not be accounted Aſſets in the hands of his Executor: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breach of this Condition for the Rent, although that the Leaſe be become void, yet the poſſeſſion of the land is not reſetled in the <hi>Queen</hi> without Office: and although the Office doth not make the Leaſe void, which was void before for non-payment of the Rent, yet before Office found the poſſeſſion is not veſted in the <hi>Queen;</hi> for before Office found we cannot award Proceſs againſt ſuch a Leſſee for his continuing the poſſeſſion after the Rent behind, and untill Office found the Leſſee cannot be found an Intruder; and Tenant at Will he cannot be, for no other Will appears of the <hi>Queen,</hi> but that in the <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> and that is to have the Leaſe void, whenſoever the Rent ſhall be behind, and that Eſtate is gone becauſe the Rent is behind; Tenant at ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he cannot be in this caſe. In caſe of a common perſon, when Leſſee for years holds over his term, he is become Tenant at ſufferance, and ſuch a Tenant ſhall not pay Rent, for it is the folly of his Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to ſuffer his Leſſee at ſufferance to continue poſſeſſion of the Land after his term, ſo as every Tenancy at ſufferance is made by the Laches of the Leſſor, which Laches cannot be imputed to the <hi>Queen:</hi> therefore here, this Leſſee, when the Condition is broken, is not a Tenant at ſufferance, nor ſhall have the profits of the Lands to his own uſe, but the Law ſhall account him to be a Bailiff of his own wrong, and ſo be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable

Sir <hi>Robert Cheſter</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Dyer</hi> 4. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 211. Sir <hi>Robert Cheſter</hi> was Receivor of the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Patent,</hi> upon condition to render Account yearly at ſuch a day, and before ſuch a day to pay the arrearages; the condition is broken, the <hi>Patent</hi> was void without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thereof found, but yet it is not altogether void, for a <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall be brought againſt the <hi>Patentee.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> leaſeth unto <hi>A.</hi> his Manor of <hi>D.</hi> and after he leaſeth alſo to the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> his Manor of <hi>S. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> that if the Leſſee doth not ſurrender his firſt Leaſe of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> at ſuch a day, that then the latter Leaſe of the Manor of <hi>S.</hi> ſhall be void: The Surrender is not made, now the Leſſee, if he continue his poſſeſſion in the Manor of <hi>S.</hi> after, he is an Intruder. Now is to ſee of what effect the Office is, not to make the Leaſe void, but to veſt the poſſeſſion in the <hi>King</hi> again: It hath been objected, That, as the caſe is, the Office is not to any purpoſe, for the <hi>Queen</hi> hath granted the inheritance over, ſo as the poſſeſſion cannot be reveſted in the <hi>Queen</hi> by that Office againſt her own Grant, nor can the <hi>Queen</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Leſſee as an Intruder for his continuance of the poſſeſſion after the Office, nor can ſeiſe the Land by ſuch Office, and there is not any ſuch Office for the benefit of a Subject, therefore the Office is meerly void. Let us compare our Caſe unto the Caſe of <hi>Ceſſavit;</hi> The Tenant of the <hi>King</hi> ceaſeth for two years, the <hi>King</hi> grants the Seignory over in fee, the Ceſſer is found by Office, the Grantee of the Seignory gains nothing by it; but that is not like unto the Caſe in queſtion, for there when the Office is found, the Tenant may ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arrearages, for the <hi>King</hi> is not abſolutely entitled by the Ceſſer, becauſe by tender of the arrearages the Tenant may ſave his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy: But in this caſe, after the Condition is once broken,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61358:77"/>
there is not any means for the Tenant to ſave the Forfeiture: alſo the <hi>King</hi> by his Grant, after the Ceſſer, hath not granted the thing which accrued unto him by the Ceſſer, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the Tenancy, but onely the Seignory: but in our caſe the <hi>King</hi> hath granted the thing forfeited, <hi>i</hi> the land demiſed: and here is a full forfeiture, contrary in the caſe of Ceſſer: And in our Caſe the <hi>King</hi> hath granted onely the land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and not the profits encurred mean between the breach of the Condition, and the Grant of the <hi>King,</hi> but theſe remain to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and to that purpoſe the Office is good, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> to entitle the <hi>Queen</hi> to theſe profits. And as to that which hath been objected, That the Leſſee hath always paid the Rent unto the <hi>Queen</hi> after the Condition broken, and hath an Acquittance of the Receipt of it, therefore no profits due to the <hi>Queen,</hi> for ſhe hath the Rent in lieu of the profits; and it is not reaſon, that the Leſſee ſhall pay an annual Rent, and alſo ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the mean profits, and ſo the Office, as unto the mean profits (which in truth upon the matter aforeſaid are not due unto the <hi>Queen</hi>) is void, and then altogether void, <hi>quia nihil operatur,</hi> To that he anſwered, That the <hi>King</hi> ſhall not be bound off the mean profits in that caſe by the payment of the ſaid Rent, for by intendment the true annual value of the Land is more than the Rent reſerved; and it is not reaſon but that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhall be anſwered of the ſurpluſage or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus above the Rent, and therefore the Office entituling the <hi>Queen</hi> to part of the profits is good enough: Tenant of the <hi>King</hi> for life, or for years, makes a Feoffment in Fee, although that by this Act he cannot pluck any thing out of the <hi>King,</hi> yet becauſe he hath attempted to do ſuch a wrong, it is a forfeiture, and the Leaſe for years utterly extinct by it; for it cannot be in the Feoffor againſt his own act, by which he hath departed with all his Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Feoffee cannot have it, for if he hath any thing, it ought to be a Fee-ſimple, or nothing at all; and a Fee-ſimple he cannot have, for that remains in the <hi>King,</hi> and ſo neither have Eſtate, then is all in the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> hath Title to have the profits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But put caſe, that after the Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>King</hi> grant over the Land in Fee, and after that tortious Feoffment is found by Office, he who accupieth the Land after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, untill Office be found, ſhall be occountable to the <hi>King</hi> for the iſſues and profits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Pernor of the profits, or Baily of his own wrong, and he who occupieth the Land after the Office ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as an Intruder. There was a Caſe very late in this Court betwixt Sir <hi>Tho. Henage</hi> and one <hi>Hungate,</hi> which was thus;<note place="margin">Sir Tho.

Some ſay,<note place="margin">Sir Walter Mildmay's Caſe.</note> that that caſe was not adjudged, but compounded: And he vouched Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi>'s Caſe: The Lord <hi>Sturton</hi> held Lands of the <hi>Queen</hi> in Knights-ſervice, and was attainted of Felony, by which the Lands eſcheated to the <hi>Queen,</hi> who granted thoſe Lands; and it was holden, that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould have the mean profits betwixt the time of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony committed, and the Grant. And after in the principal Caſe Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the <hi>Patentee</hi> of the <hi>Queen</hi> againſt the Leſſee; who caſt in a <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> and by his Council prayed, That the <hi>Writ of Error</hi> be not broken open untill the Iudgment be entred. <hi>Manwood,</hi> The Iudgment hath reference and relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt day of this Term, and therefore do not doubt of that.</p>

That the father, to prevent Wardſhip, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien, and take to him and his ſon, and the heirs of the father, which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief was intended to be remedied by the ſaid Statute: But theſe words ſhall not in conſtruction thereof extend farther than the words e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, becauſe they croſs the Common Law, and go to charge the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of others; and therefore they ſhall be taken ſtrictly, and not by equity: as the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 40. <hi>Cum quis alienat jus uxoris ſuae, concordat. eſt, Quod de cetero ſecta mulieris aut ejus haeredis non differatur propter minorem aetatem haeredis, qui warrantizare debuit,</hi> that Statute is taken ſtrictly; for if the Vouchee voucheth over, the ſecond Vouchee ſhall have his age, <hi>Quod vide</hi> 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 16.

That none ſhall vouch out of the line upon that Statute, although the Tenant to the Action againſt whom the <hi>Praecipe</hi> is brought, is bound by the Statute, yet Tenant by receit is at large, and he may vouch at the Common Law: 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. 16 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. for theſe Statutes go in abridgment of the Common Law, and therefore ſhall be taken ſtrictly: Now, according to this Statute, it is of the ſame nature as the other before remembred, and therefore ſhall not be extended in conſtruction beyond the Letter. As Sir <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Hill</hi>'s Caſe, Grandfather, father and ſon, the grandfather ſeiſed of Land, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> makes a Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of himſelf for life, and afterwards to the uſe of the ſon in Fee, The grandfather dieth, the father dieth, the ſon ſhall not be in Ward, <hi>Cauſa qua ſupra,</hi> For this Statute ſhall not be conſtrued by equity, and by it the words thereof, <hi>[Preferment of children]</hi> ſhall not extend unto the childrens children, but to the children onely of the King's Tenant, who makes the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And the words in this Statute <hi>[or otherwiſe]</hi> ſhall not be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to other perſons than are remembred in the Statute. There was a Caſe late, where the Statute was conſtrued in ſuch a manner, <hi>Quod vide</hi> 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 345. <hi>Thornton</hi>'s Caſe; A Lady, ſeiſed of Lands in chief, made Conveyance of her Lands, for the advancement of her baſtard-daughter, the ſame Conveyance is not within the Statute: See alſo the Lord <hi>Powes</hi>'s Caſe, 14 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 313. So in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Hugh Calverley,</hi> the Law was taken, That where the Husband dieth ſeiſed in the right of his Wife, and they levy a Fine unto the uſe of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, for the advancement of the Husband; ſuch Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and diſpoſition is not within the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Popham,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, And as to the Caſe of making this Statute, it was not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a foundation, as it hath been ſaid; but it was rather a gratuity of the Subjects to the King for his bounty towards them; for whereas by the Statute of Vſes, Vſes were executed in poſſeſſion, ſo as the Subjects could not diſpoſe of their Lands, by their Wills, as before the Vſes: Now, by this Statute, the King was pleaſed to give his Royal aſſent to an Act, by which Lands might become deviſable, in reſpect of which, the Subjects added to this Act, the laſt clauſe, to give him Wardſhip, where it did not lie before by the Common Law, and that as a recompence from the Subjects for the King's bounty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be conſtrued beneficially for the King. And to prevent covin and fraud, was not the ſcope of this Statute; For if three pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Lands unto them, and to the heirs of two of them; now it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whoſe heirs ſhall inherit, for <hi>non conſtat,</hi> which of them ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and therefore no covin is averrable in ſuch caſe; and yet if the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor of two to whom the Fee is limited dieth, his heir within age, ſuch heir ſhall be in Ward: So if ſuch Lands be given to two, and to the heirs of him of thoſe two who ſhall firſt come to the Church of <hi>Paul;</hi> Now it is uncertain which of them ſhall firſt come to the Church of <hi>Paul,</hi> yet if he who firſt cometh to the Church of <hi>Paul</hi> dieth, his heir within age, he ſhall be in Ward; which Caſes prove, that covin and fraud were not the cauſe of making this Statute, but onely the thankfulneſs of the Subjects unto the King for his bounty, as aboveſaid; for if this Act had not been made, the Subjects ſhould not have power to diſpoſe of their Lands for the advancement of their children, but all ſhould deſcend: So as now the King hath loſt the Wardſhip and Primer ſeiſin of two parts of the Lands of his Tenant, and hath alſo loſt the averment of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, which he had by the Common Law, where Eſtates were made by the King's Tenant for advancement of their children. In reſpect of which loſſes, the Subjects gave unto the King Wardſhip in caſe where the Lands continue in jointure: as to that which hath been ſaid; That this Statute ſhall not be taken by equity, I conceive the contrary; the words of the Statute are, <hi>In every ſuch caſe, i. e.</hi> In every like caſe, not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61358:80"/>
onely where two, or more perſons hold jointly to them and the heirs of one of them, but alſo in every the like Caſe; as the Caſe now in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in every Caſe where the life of him who hath the Freehold, is the ſole impediment, <hi>quo minus,</hi> the heir hath not the Land by deſcent in Demeſne: And it may be reſembled unto the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge</hi> of Colluſion, which ſpeaks of Leaſes for years, <hi>Quas tradere voluerint ad terminum annorum;</hi> and yet a Leaſe for life, or Leaſe for years is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid Statute; for the Statute was made in reſtraint of an ill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that the Tenants had by the Common Law in prejudice of their Lords, which ſee 4 <hi>E.</hi> 6. 53. <hi>&amp; Plow.</hi> 59. And as to the word <hi>[otherwiſe]</hi> that may be conſtrued, for payment of his Legacies: And as to equity enlarging, the Statute ſpeaks <hi>[where many hold, and to the heirs of one;]</hi> yet, if two hold, to them and the heirs of one of them, the ſame is within the Statute: And as to Equity reſtraining, he puts this caſe; Land is given to the Husband and Wife, and the heirs of the body of the Wife, who have iſſue, the Wife dieth, the iſſue within age, he ſhall not be in Ward; and yet he is within the Letter of the Statute, but becauſe that other matter, That the Eſtate for life, in the Husband is an impediment, <hi>Quo minus,</hi> he ſhall be in Ward: It is a maxim of the Common Law, That the father ſhall have the Wardſhip of the ſon and heir apparent, therefore he ſhall not be within the meaning, although he be within the Letter of the Statute: So, if Lands be given to my Villain, and to another, and to the heirs of my Villain, who dieth ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, his heir within age, I ſeiſe the Villain, and claim the remainder, he ſhall not be in Ward; and yet he is within the Letter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: But I conceive, in our Caſe, the King ſhall have two Wards, <hi>Simul &amp; ſemel,</hi> the heir general of <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> and the iſſue in tail; the heir general by the Common Law, by reaſon that his father was the King's Tenant, who diſpoſed of his Lands for the advancement of his children; and therefore the Queen ſhall have the third part in Ward: And alſo the heir ſpecial ſhall be in Ward, for that part of the Statute. And it is no new thing to have two Wardſhips for one and the ſame Lands: As 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of the heir of <hi>Ceſtuy quae uſe,</hi> and alſo of the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee; and if the Tenant dieth ſeiſed, having iſſue a daughter, who is his heir, the Lord ſeiſeth the daughter, and marrieth her, and afterwards a ſon is born; he ſhall have the Wardſhip alſo of him: So of the heirs of the Diſſeiſor and Diſſeiſee; and he ſaid, If Lands holden in chief be leaſed for life, the remainder to <hi>A.</hi> in Fee, <hi>A.</hi> dieth, his heir within age, he ſhall be in Ward, and that by reaſon of theſe words in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>[In every ſuch caſe]</hi> it is not the ſame Caſe, but the like Caſe; for if he who hath the Fee dieth, ſo as the Freehold ſurvives to the other; now the Eſtate becomes as an Eſtate for life, the remainder over. It was adjourned.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Puckering,</hi> Serjeant: Firſt, it is to ſee, if by the words of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Queen <hi>Mary; viz. De ampliori gratia, &amp;c.</hi> the Reverſion in Fee which the Queen had, ſhall paſs or not? Secondly, Admitting that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61358:83"/>
the Reverſion doth not paſs, then if the Fine levied by <hi>Andrew Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to the Plaintiff, the Reverſion being in the Queen, be a bar unto the iſſue in tail? For as unto the firſt Fine levied, 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which was without Proclamations, the ſame ſhall not bind the iſſue in tail, neither as to the right, nor as to the Entry, for it is not any diſcontinuance, becauſe the Reverſion is in the King; as of things which do not lie in diſcontinuance, as Rent, Common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſuch a Fine is a Fine at the Common Law, and not within the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and ſuch Fine is void againſt the iſſue: But if ſuch a Fine without Proclamation be levied of a thing which lieth in diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then ſuch a Fine is not void, but voidable by <hi>Formedon:</hi> and therefore this Fine in the Caſe at Bar being levied without Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Lands entailed, whereof the Reverſion is in the King at the time of the Fine levied, ſhall not bind the iſſue: and by ſuch Fine the Conuſee hath nothing but a Fee determinable upon the life of Tenant in tail, which Fee was forfeited to the Queen by the <hi>Attainder</hi> of the Lord <hi>Seymore,</hi> and that the Queen moved of pity, did reſtore the ſame to <hi>A. B.</hi> in recompence; for the Indentures of themſelves were not ſufficient to raiſe any uſe: See 1 <hi>Mariae, Dyer</hi> 96. As to the firſt point, it ſeems that nothing paſſed of the Reverſion, for the Grant hath reference to the words, <hi>All her Right, Poſſeſſion, &amp;c.</hi> which came to her <hi>ratione attincturae,</hi> and all the reſidue of the Grant ought to have reference to that, to the <hi>ratione attincturae,</hi> which was the foundation of the whole Grant: and here the intent of the Queen was not to any other intent but onely to reſtore <hi>A. B.</hi> to the ſaid Manor, or to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Eſtate in it; and nothing appears in the Letters Patents, by which it may appear, that the Queen was knowing of her Reverſion which ſhe had by deſcent, and therefore the ſame cannot paſs by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words. If the Queen grants the Goods and Chattels of all thoſe which have done any Treſpaſs, for which <hi>vitam amittere debent,</hi> the Goods of him who is attainted of Treaſon ſhall not be forfeited to the Grantee by ſuch general words: 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. The King grants <hi>omnia Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talla Tenentium ſuorum, qualitercunque damnatorum,</hi> the ſame ſhall not extend to the Goods of him who is condemned of Treaſon: See 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 49. So in our Caſe the Patent ſhall not ſerve to two intents, but to a reſtitution of the Manor, and then nothing paſſed by this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent but the Fee determinable, which was conveyed to the Lord <hi>Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> and forfeited by his <hi>Attainder.</hi> Then we are to ſee, how after this grant the ſaid <hi>A. B.</hi> is ſeiſed. And he ſaid, That he ſhall be in of the ſaid Fee determinable, and not of the Eſtate tail againſt his own Fine; and then if he be not ſeiſed by force of the Entail at the time of the Fine levied, 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſame Fine cannot bind the tail: But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that at the time of the ſecond Fine levied he was in of an Eſtate in tail, yet the ſame Fine ſhall not bar his iſſue: For firſt, this Fine cannot make any diſcontinuance, becauſe that the Reverſion in Fee is in the King, which is not touched by the Fine: See the Caſe of <hi>Sanders,</hi> where <hi>A.</hi> makes a Leaſe to begin at a day to come, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards levies a Fine to a ſtranger with Proclamations; the five years paſs, and afterwards at the day of the Commencement of the Leaſe the Leſſee enters, his entry is lawfull, and he ſhall not be bound by the <hi>non</hi>-claim. And ſo it was adjudged 21 <hi>Eliz</hi> between <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Starky.</hi> After the making of the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. of Fines, it was much doubted, if the iſſues of common Tenants in tail ſhould be bound by a Fine with Proclamation, foraſmuch as upon the death of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours they were as new purchaſors <hi>per formam doni:</hi> and therefore it was provided by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that the ſaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ſhould extend to ſuch common Entails; but there was no doubt of the Eſtate tail of the Gift of the King: and ſee betwixt <hi>Jackſon</hi> and <hi>Darcy, Mich.</hi> 15 and 16 <hi>Elizab.

facienda,</hi> the Caſe was, Tenant in tail, the Remainder to the King after the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. levied a Fine with Proclamations, and adjudged, that that ſhould bind the iſſues: and the Act of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not extend, but where the Reverſion is in the King, but no mention is there of a Remainder, becauſe the words of the ſaid Act are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>of all Tenants in tail,</hi> the makers of the ſaid Act perceiving that it might be a doubt, that the generality of the ſaid words might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Eſtates tail of the Gift of the King, they have reſtrained the words in a ſpecial manner, as appeareth by the laſt words of the ſame Act: Nor to any Fines heretofore levied, or hereafter to be levied by any perſon or perſons of any Manors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of the ſaid Fine to any of his or their Anceſtors in tail by Letters Patents, or Act of Parliament, the Reverſion whereof, at the time of the levying of ſuch Fine, was in the King: and ſo ſuch Eſtates are excepted, and that in ſuch Caſes where ſuch Fines are levied, they ſhall be of ſuch force as they ſhould have been if the ſaid Act had not been made; and therefore he conceived, it appeared at the ſaid Parliament, That ſuch Eſtate tails of the Gift of the King were not bound b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Walmſley,</hi> Serjeant, to the contrary; and he agreed, That the firſt Fine doth not make any diſcontinuance; and yet he conceived, it is not altogether void againſt the iſſues before that they enter, for no Right remains in the Conuſor againſt his Fine: and he conceived alſo that this clauſe, <hi>ex uberiori gratia noſtra,</hi> did extend to paſs more than paſſed before, for he conceived that the Queen intended more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reverſion, for this ſame is not any matter of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, but this is a matter of intereſt which might even in the Caſe of the King paſs out of the King by general words: And ſee 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 6 and 7 <hi>Br. Patents;</hi> A Grant of the King <hi>ex inſinuatione</hi> ſhall not hinder the force of the words <hi>ex mero motu.</hi> And the opinion of the Court was, That the Reverſion which was in the King did not paſs by this Grant: For the ſcope of the whole Patent was, as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to grant the ſame onely which the Queen had <hi>ratione attincturae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anderſon</hi> held the Patent inſufficient, becauſe that the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not full and certain: Alſo he ſaid, That <hi>ex ſpeciali gratia, &amp;c.</hi> would not help this Caſe, if it were well argued, for the Eſtate tail is not well recited, but onely that he was ſeiſed <hi>de Statu haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as the Queen was deceived. <hi>Periam,</hi> contrary; The Queen was appriſed well of the miſchief and Grant aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſuch Eſtate, with which he departed by the Fine. And as to the other point, it was the opinion of <hi>Walmſley,</hi> That the Fine with Proclamation did bind the Entail. And as to the Objection which hath been made, That the Conuſor, at the time of the Fine levied, was not ſeiſed by force of the Entail, the ſame had been good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to avoid a common Recovery, to alledge ſuch matter in the Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe,</hi> but not to this purpoſe: for if Tenant in tail levieth a Fine, although he was not ſeiſed at the time of the Fine levied by force of the Entail, yet ſuch a Fine ſhall bind the iſſues: So if the Tenant in tail doth diſcontinue, and diſſeiſeth the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuee, and ſo levieth a Fine. And he conceived, That the iſſue in tail is bound by the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. even of the Gift of the King. And ſee 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. and 7. where it is holden, That the iſſue in tail is bound by the Act of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And whereas it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That it doth not extend, but to ſuch Fines which make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance at the Common Law; the ſame is not ſo: for if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail of a Rent or Common levieth a Fine with Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is very clear, that the iſſues ſhall be barred thereby: And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied much upon the Book of 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer.</hi> 32. Tenant in tail of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61358:84"/>
Gift of the <hi>King</hi> levyeth a Fine, or ſuffereth a common Recovery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not a diſcontinuance, becauſe the Reverſion is in the <hi>King,</hi> yet it is a bar unto the iſſue.

As to the Statute of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. It is to be known, That the common Law <hi>[before acquitted]</hi> was a good Plea, and the cauſe was for the great regard that the common Law had to the life of a man; In which caſe a great miſchief, as the Statute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, did enſue, that to ſave the appeal of the party; they would not arraign the party within the year and day after the murther, within which time, the offender did compound with the party intereſſed; and ſo after the year expired, all the matter concerning the proſecution, at the King's ſuit, was put in oblivion: wherefore it was enacted, That ſuch offender ſhall be within the year arraigned at the ſuit of the King; and if the party be acquitted at the Kings ſuit, within the year and day, That the Iuſtices before whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould not ſet the party at large, but to remain in priſon, or to let him to bail, untill the year and the day be paſt; and within the ſaid year and day, the wife, or next heir to the party ſlain may take their appeal againſt the party ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted or attainted, the ſaid acquittal or attainder notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and he ſaid, that theſe words <hi>[perſon attainted]</hi> did not extend to perſon convicted; for they are two diſtinct conditions in Law; for attainder procures corruption of bloud, but the ſame is not wrought by conviction: and every Treaſon imports in it ſelf Felony; but yet notwithſtanding they are diſtinct Offences: See 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>Coron.</hi> 44. where it was ordered by all the Iuſtices of <hi>England,</hi> That none ſhould be arraigned of the death of a man, at the ſuit of the King, within the year and day; ſo as the ſuit of the party be ſaved. And the Iuſtices counſelled all men of Law ſo to do, and that the ſame be executed as a Law without alteration, upon which rule of the Iuſtices, aroſe an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; for after that order of the Iuſtices was known, The offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would practiſe with the party to whom the appeal by the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, to obtain from him a releaſe for ſome ſum of money, and then when the year and day paſſed, the heinouſneſs of the murther was out of memory; This miſchief being eſpied, was the occaſion of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Statute of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. But the ſaid Statute doth not meet with our Caſe; but our Caſe is at the common Law, for this Statute extends onely unto perſons attainted; but a perſon convicted is not touched by it, and therefore being out of the words of the Statute, it ſhall be alſo out of the meaning of it; for being a penal Law, it ſhall be taken by equity, as all Statutes which give attaint ſhall be, <hi>Stricti juris,</hi> and ſhall not be taken by equity. It hath been objected, that the Statute <hi>de Frangentibus priſonam,</hi> 4 <hi>E.</hi> 1. hath been taken by equity, the ſame is not ſo; for it is not any penal Law, but the ſame mitigates the rigor of the common Law; for before that Statute, the breaking of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was Felony in every caſe, but now it is not Felony, but where the party was committed to priſon for Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61358:86"/>
it was at the common Law, for he hath puniſhment enough in that by that plea, if it be falſe, he hath by way of concluſion given the moye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Land in demand to him with whom he hath pleaded Ioynt-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; and the Law doth not intend that he would ſo ſlightly depart with his land for the abatement of a <hi>Writ:</hi> As in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> the Tenant acknowledgeth himſelf to be Villein to a ſtranger; the <hi>Writ</hi> ſhall abate without any averment, if Frank and of Frank Eſtate; for the Law preſumes, that the Tenant would not enthral his condition. <hi>Wray,</hi> to the ſame intent: But the Demandant may confeſs and avoid the Fine, as to ſay, That he that levyed the Fine was his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor, upon whom he had before entred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if Tenant in Fee-ſimple be impleaded, and he ſaith that he is Tenant for life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder over to <hi>A.</hi> in Fee, and prayes in aid of <hi>A.</hi> the Demandant ſhall not take averment, that the Tenant, the day of the <hi>Writ</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, was ſeiſed in Fee.

The Villain of the King in the right of his Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> purchaſeth Lands, the King ſeizeth, he ſhall be ſeiſed thereof in the right of his Crown, and not of the Dutchy: The King grants Common out of certain Lands par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of his ſaid Dutchy, and afterwards makes a Feoffment of the ſaid Lands to another, the Grantee of the Common dieth without heir, ſo as the Common eſcheats to him; now he ſhall have the Common in the right of the Crown and not of the Dutchy; ſo although it is ſaid, That the Rent ſhall follow the nature of the Land out of which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the ſame is but to ſome intents, and not to every intent: See the Statute of 2 and 3 <hi>Phil. &amp; Ma. cap.</hi> 20. by which it is enacted, That all the Lands which have been granted or ſevered from the Dutchy to any perſon or perſons, and after ſuch grant, have come or reverted to the King in poſſeſſion, reverſion or remainder, or otherwiſe by attainder, eſcheat, forfeiture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall for ever be united to the ſaid Dutchy, and ſhall be adjudged and eſteemed as part and member of the ſame; which proves that ſuch Lands were not holden of the King, as Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> but as King; for if they had been holden of the Dutchy upon the eſcheat, they ſhould be parcel of the Dutchy again, without help of that Statute. See the ſpecial Reſervation; <hi>Reddendo Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Regi, &amp; haeredibus ſuis, aut illi cui de jure reddi debet, &amp;c.</hi> Now, when the King grants the <hi>Seignory</hi> to the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> it was in the Election of the Ter-tenant, to whom he would pay the Rent, if it had been in the Caſe of a common perſon; but it is otherwiſe in the Caſe of the King: As if <hi>A.</hi> holdeth of two ſeveral Lords by owel Feoffment, and dieth, his heir within age; the Lord which firſt gets the Ward ſhall have him; but in the Caſe of the King it is otherwiſe: <hi>Plowden,</hi> The King is not bound by the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 3.

The onely queſtion was, inaſmuch as the Cordwaynors of <hi>London</hi> are incorporated by the name of Maſter and Wardens and Commonalty of Cordwaynors, If this deviſe made to them by the name of Maſter and Wardens of the Cordwaynors of <hi>London</hi> be good or not? It was argued by <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the Deviſe by the manner was good enough; and he inſiſted much upon the favour which the Law gives to Wills, and to Legatees in the Deviſes and conſtruction of them, even in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes and Grants to Corporations: and as to Grants to Corporations, he cited the Caſe of the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Norwich: Decanus &amp; Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum ſanctae &amp; individuae Trinit.</hi> and they make a Leaſe, leaving out theſe words <hi>[ſanctae &amp; individuae]</hi> and yet held the Leaſe was good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, for the words left out, are not words of ſubſtance of the name, but for the beauty and ornament of it: But in the Caſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, if the name be miſtaken in matter of ſubſtance, yet if upon the Deviſe the intent of the Deviſor ſufficiently appeareth, it is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: for the intent of the Deviſor ſhall guide the Deviſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Deviſe, the Fee-ſimple ſhall paſs without the word <hi>[Heirs.]</hi> And he ſaid, that the opinion of <hi>Wray,</hi> chief Iuſtice, was in the Caſe of the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Pauls:</hi> If I deviſe that my Executors ſhall aſſign my Lands to <hi>J.

The Abbat of <hi>Fountain</hi>'s Caſe, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 32. the cuſtome of the Abby was, That at every vacation of the Abbat, the Monks ſhould proceed to a new Election, and that he who ſhould be choſen by the greater number of the Monks, ſhould be Abbat: and the Caſe was, That upon ſuch avoidance, one <hi>A.</hi> was elected by the greater number of voices, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> 22 Monks.

At another day, the Caſe was argued by <hi>Walmſley</hi> Serjeant, That the ſentence <hi>definitive</hi> of the ſpiritual Court, in cauſe of divorce, <hi>cauſa frigiditatis,</hi> ſhould ſtand; and he argued much in what manner the Law of the Church, and the Law of the Law ſhould determine marriage: and he argued that the right of marriage, was determinable by the ſpiritual Law; and he ſaid, that ſuch ſentences ought to be paſſed by our Law: and taken notice of; and therefore he who pleads a Divorce, ought to ſhew before what Iudge the Divorce is had, to the intent the Iudges may know to what perſons they ſhall write for the trial of it; and it appears in our books, That our Law takes upon it the Conuſance of the competency of an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Iudge; which ſee, 2 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 15 and 16.

And after, at another day, by the appointment of the Iuſtices, the Caſe was argued in Court by the Civilians and Canoniſts: <hi>Goldingham,</hi> on the part of the Plaintiff, and <hi>Steward</hi> on the part of the Defendant: And firſt it was ſaid on the Plaintiff's part, That by the ſentence, all the matter, <hi>tranſit in rem judicatam,</hi> and therefore we ſhall not reſort to the matter cenſured, the ſentence being in its force. And as to that, it was answered by <hi>Steward,</hi> That <hi>tranſit in rem judicatam,</hi> but not in caſe of marriage, and in the like caſes, where <hi>vertitur periculum animae;</hi> for in ſuch caſes the ſentences are ſubject to the ſucceſs; as if after it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Eccleſiam fuiſſe deceptam per errorem licet probabilem (ut illi loquun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur)</hi> for then <hi>periculum animae vertitur,</hi> for then they ſhould continue their Adultery, unleſs the ſentence of the Church be annulled. <hi>Goldingham,</hi> It <hi>tranſit in rem judicatam, non quoad inſtantiam, non quoad cauſam:</hi> ſo that as long as the ſentence is in force, it is <hi>cauſa judicata;</hi> yet the cauſe is ſubject to the cenſure of the Church. <hi>Steward,</hi> in our Caſe here, all our Books are, <hi>Matrimonium ſit nullum: Goldingham,</hi> The words are alſo in ſuch, <hi>reparabitur matrimonium,</hi> in which it is implied, that ſome ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the holy Church is requiſite in ſuch reparation of marriage. <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> where a man is divorced, <hi>cauſa frigiditatis,</hi> it is prohibited by ſuch ſentence that he ſhall not marry again, and if he doth marry, he is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in our Law perjured, and an Adulterer; and to that purpoſe he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted divers authorities of the Canon Law. <hi>Goldingham,</hi> This ſentence is not properly a Divorce, for here was never properly a marriage: as in Caſes <hi>de praecontract.</hi> Divorce upon that cannot be ſaid properly a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, but a ſentence of the Church upon the errour of the parties: and he put many degrees of impoſitions in ſuch caſes, <hi>Perpetua frigiditas, &amp; naturalis impotentia generandi; frigiditas ex malefacio: i. e. quoad unam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam perſonam,</hi> and many others, <hi>quae poſſunt matrimonium contrah, &amp; dirimere contractum:</hi> and the ſentences which in our Law, are <hi>contra jus conſtitutionis:</hi> as where there is not any Citation, Declaration, or that the ſentence is of another thing than that which is contained in the Libell, in ſuch caſes the ſentence is utterly void; but ſentences there given, <hi>contra jus partis,</hi> are voidable onely; See <hi>Panormit. fraternita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis: Si notorie apparet ſententiam Divortii fuiſſe injuſtam, libet revocari, non obſtante quod non fuerit appellat.

                  <p>Afterwards, that is to ſay, <hi>Mich.</hi> 30 and 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Caſe was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved again, and Iudgment was prayed for the Plaintiff; and then the Lord <hi>Anderſon, Ex aſſenſu ſociorum,</hi> commanded that Iudgment ſhould be entred for the Plaintiff; and ſhewed unto the Council of both parties, That about the Certificate, which the four Doctors have ſhewed unto us, of their opinions upon the point, we our ſelves have conferred with the ſaid Doctors, who have given us their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, That the ſaid ſentence of Divorce being yet in force, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed is peremptory, and not ſubject to the ſucceſs: and although in the examinations and depoſitions taken in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, no matter appeareth, upon which ſuch peremptory Divorce might be granted, yet it might be, as we are informed by the ſaid Doctors, that upon the examination of Phyſicians and Matrons, ſufficient matter did appear to the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Iudges, (which for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſake ought not to be entred of Record) and that appeareth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſentence; <hi>i.

And the party robbed is not bound to give notice to the Inhabitants, nor to direct them which way the Felons took their flight, but the Inhabitants are bound to follow the Felons without
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61358:92"/>
any ſuch inſtruction, and after the Enqueſt was taken, and gave a Verdict in this manner: That whereas the Plaintiff had declared, That the Robbery was done in the Pariſh of <hi>D.</hi> in the Hundred afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Iury found, that the place where the Robbery was done, is a Lane within the ſaid Hundred; and that the one ſide of the ſaid Lane is within the Pariſh of <hi>S.</hi> and the other ſide within the ſaid Pariſh of <hi>D.</hi> and that the Robbery was done in the ſide of the ſaid Lane, which was in the Pariſh of <hi>S.</hi> and prayed the opinion of the Court upon that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And the Court was clear of opinion, That notwithſtanding that Exception, the Plaintiff ſhould have Iudgment; for here is the right Hundred which ought to be charged; and the miſtaking of the Pariſh is not to any purpoſe. But then it was moved on the part of the Plaintiff; that for as much as the Verdict aforeſaid was ſpecial, by reaſon of the doubt which the Iurors conceived upon the miſtaking of the Pariſh, in the Plaintiff's Declaration, That the charges of the Iurors ſhould be indifferently born by both parties, as the courſe is in caſes of ſpecial Verdicts; but the whole Court was clear againſt that, and commanded that the Plaintiff alone ſhould pay the ſaid charges, for the matter here found ſpecially is not any doubt; but out of all queſtion, for it is clear that the Action is well brought, for as much as the Hundred is charged, the miſtaking of the Pariſh ſhall not hurt.</p>

                  <p>IN Treſpaſs for carrying away of Tithes, the Caſe was; That <hi>Frankwell,</hi> Parſon of the Church of <hi>D.</hi> was accuſed, <hi>in forma Juris,</hi> before the high Commiſſioners, who pleaded, that the ſame cauſe and crime was proſecuted againſt him in the <hi>Arches,</hi> and prayed that he might not be doubly vexed for one and the ſame offence; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he was deprived, and another Clerk preſented to the ſame Church by the Patron, and was admitted, inſtituted and inducted; and upon entry, brought Treſpaſs againſt the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent. And note, the manner of the Deprivation, as it was found by Verdict: That the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> with the aſſent of the other Commiſſioners, gave ſentence of Deprivation againſt him; and it was ſhewed, That the high Commiſſioners had not power by 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to give ſentence of any thing which is dependant in another Court: For it was not the intent of the ſaid Act, to take away the jurisdiction of the other Eccleſiaſtical Courts; for then it is in vain to have ſuch Courts: It was alſo moved, becauſe the pleading is, That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London, ex aſſenſu</hi> of the other Commiſſioners, gave ſentence, the ſame is a void ſentence; for it ought to be the ſentence of all the Commiſſioners, for they ſhall have equal authority: And to this purpoſe, he cited the Caſe, 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 40. where a Leaſe is made of Lands, whereof the Dean and Chapter are ſeiſed, in common, <hi>per nomen Decani ex aſſenſu, &amp; conſenſu totius Capitul.</hi> but it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a void Leaſe; for the Chapter ought to be party to ſuch Leaſe; contrary, where the Leaſe is made of the Land which is the proper and peculiar Inheritance of the Dean: But that Exception was not allowed; for the form of Entries in all caſes, hath always been ſo. <hi>Coke, poſito,</hi> That the Commiſſioners ought not to proceed in this Caſe, yet, becauſe they have ſo done, the ſame ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined here; for the Iudges here, ought to think that this Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was duly ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61358:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not be helped here. <hi>Fenner,</hi> 16 <hi>Eliz.</hi> One <hi>Foxe</hi> was deprived the laſt day of the Parliament for incontinency, which offence was pardoned by the ſame Parliament, and that ſentence of Deprivation was holden void. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> In your Caſe, the offence it ſelf was pardoned and diſcharged: Alſo it is againſt a general Statute, of which every one ought to take notice. <hi>Periam,</hi> When the Caſe was in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> it was moved; If of a ſentence given by the high Commiſſioners, an Appeal did lie; and it was certified by <hi>Clark,</hi> Doctor of the civil Law, that it did; for the Commiſſioners are as the Delegates of the Queen: And as by the Canon Law one might appeal from the Delegates of the Pope, unto the perſon of the Pope; ſo now, one may appeal from the high Commiſſioners, to the perſon of the Queen: See for that, 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 12.

And he put the caſe of <hi>Bro. Feoff. to Uſes,</hi> 50. 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And there is a great difference betwixt an Vſe limited before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and after the Statute; for now, after the Statute, the Feoffees have not any ſeiſin, whereof they may make a Feoffment: And he put the caſe between <hi>Cheney</hi> and <hi>Oxenbridge; Cheney</hi> leaſed to <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> for 60 years, and afterwards enfeoffed <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Cheney</hi> and his wife for their lives, with divers remainders over; and it was adjudged in the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> that by the Feoffment the term was not extinct: And he put the caſe of the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> adjudged. A Feoffment was made unto the uſe of the Feoffor for life, the remainder to him whom the Feoffor ſhould name at his death, in Fee; the Feoffor and the Feoffees for good conſideration, levied a Fine unto a ſtranger, and afterwards the Feoffor named one and died, the party named by the Feoffor ſhall have the land, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Fine. <hi>Beamount,</hi> The contingent uſe here, is utterly deſtroyed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61358:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Feoffment aforeſaid; and it appeareth by the preamble of the Act of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. That the makers of the Act did not favour Vſes, but their intent was utterly to extirpate Vſes: And if contingent Vſes which are not, nor cannot be excuſed by the Statute ſhould ſtand in force, The miſchief would be, That no purchaſor ſhould be ſecured and ſafe in his purchaſe, but ſhould always be in danger of a new born Vſe, not known before; and he grounded his farther argument upon the reaſon of <hi>Manwood</hi> and <hi>Dyer,</hi> Where a man makes a Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of himſelf and his Wife which ſhall be, and afterwards he and the Feoffees, and thoſe in remainder, make a Feoffment to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers new Feoffees, and to new Vſes; and afterwards he takes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wife, and dieth: It was the opinion of the ſaid two Iudges, That by that Feoffment, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> the contingent Vſes are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For when the Eſtate which the Feoffees accept is taken away, which was the root and foundation of the Vſes which are the branches and fruit of the body of the ſaid Tree, it neceſſarily followeth, That they be alſo taken away; and becauſe the Feoffees by their Livery, are barred to enter to recontinue the Eſtate which ſhould yield ſuch Vſes, they alſo are gone and extinguiſhed. <hi>Yelverton</hi> was of opinion, that notwithſtanding the ſaid Feoffment, that the Vſe ſhould riſe in his due time according to the limitation of it.

                     <note place="margin">Ante 4.</note> was brought by <hi>Savacre</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, M.</hi> 31 and 32 <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon a Iudgment given in a <hi>Quare Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit,</hi> for the Queen. And Error aſſigned: 1. An <hi>Attachment</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded againſt the Defendant in the <hi>Quare Impedit;</hi> retornable <hi>Quind. Paſch.</hi> at which <hi>Savacre</hi> appeared, and caſt an <hi>Eſſoin;</hi> and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, a <hi>Diſtringas</hi> was awarded againſt them both, retorned, <hi>Craſt. Trin.</hi> and the awarding the <hi>Diſtringas</hi> was erronious; for the <hi>Eſſoin</hi> was as an appearance for to ſave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore againſt him no <hi>Diſtringas</hi> ought to have been awarded: And upon alledging of Diminution, the Record of the <hi>Eſſoin</hi> was certified; for the ſame did not appear upon the Plea Roll. 2 The Record is, <hi>Ipſi in Miſericord.</hi> and ſo both of the Defendants are amerced for the default of appearance, <hi>Quind. Paſch.</hi> whereas <hi>Savacre</hi> was then Eſſoined, and ſo no cauſe of amerciment of him. <hi>Coke,</hi> The original <hi>Writ</hi> was here ſued, <hi>Mic.</hi> 26 <hi>Eliz.</hi> retornable <hi>Quind. Hillar.</hi> and then both the Defendants made default, for which an <hi>Attachment</hi> was awarded retornable, 15 <hi>Paſ.</hi> and then <hi>Savacre</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and Iudgment was given, <hi>Quod ipſi ſint in Miſericord.</hi> in which point the Error is aſſigned: But I conceive, that it is not Error; for upon the <hi>Attachment,</hi> the parties ought to put in ſureties for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: and the ſaid ſureties took upon them, that the Defendants, and each of them ſhould appear, and if they, or one of them maketh default, the ſureties ſhould be amerced; and ſo here, this Iudgment, <hi>Ideo ipſi in Miſericord.</hi> ſhall refer to the ſureties, not to the parties: for the Defendants ſhall not be amerced untill the end of the ſuit, and but once onely in one action, which ſee, Book of <hi>Entries,</hi> 464. where there was but one Defendant; and therefore, If the amerciment ſhall refer to the Defendant, then it ſhould be, <hi>Ideo ipſe,</hi> not <hi>ipſi, &amp;c.</hi> and that is the reaſon, wherefore neither the Queen nor an Infant ſhall find pledges, for no amerciament ſhall be upon their default, therefore in vain for them to find pledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if the pledges be amerced where they ought not to be amerced by the Law, yet the Defendant ſhall not have Error upon it, for he is not the party grieved by that amerciament. And upon this reaſon it is, That in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the bail, if erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Iudgment be given againſt him, the Defendant in the Action ſhall not have a <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> The awarding of the Diſtreſs upon the Roll againſt both, where the one of them onely makes default, is not error, eſpecially as this caſe is; for though that one of them was Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoined untill the day aforeſaid, yet at the ſaid day they make default, and ſo the Diſtreſs is well awarded againſt him; and although that the <hi>Writ</hi> were ill awarded; yet when they appear, <hi>Cr. Trinit.</hi> at the day of the retorn of the Diſtreſs, all mean defaults in the Proceſs are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſo the miſawarding of the Diſtreſs, by appearance afterwards is ſupplyed: As 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 7. The Law requires that in an action groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Statute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Defendant hath warning by two Months; yet if the Defendant having not had ſuch warning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, the Proceſs is well enough: So 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 18. Where, upon any
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61358:98"/>
Proceſs the Defendant appeareth, although the day of appearance be not lawfull, yet the parties ſhall be put to anſwer: and ſee many caſes there to the ſame purpoſe: and ſuch was the opinion of the Court in the principal Caſe. And as to the ſecond Error, that the Iudgment, <hi>Ideo ipſi in Miſeric.</hi> ſhall be referred to the ſureties onely, and not unto the party; and that the Defendant ſhall be but once amerced in one action, the ſame is true, that he ſhall be but once amerced for one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault; but if many defaults be, the Defendant ſhall be ſeverally amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for every default: And it ſhould be unreaſonable that the ſureties ſhould be amerced, and that the Defendant who is as principal ſhould go free: See the Book of <hi>Entries,</hi> 193. <hi>Ipſi &amp; plegii ſui in Miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, &amp;c.</hi>

ſeiſed; and farther it was found, that the ſaid <hi>H.</hi> was alſo ſeiſed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands, in <hi>Barmeſden</hi> in his Demeſne as of Fee, and therefore died ſeiſed; and now came <hi>Gray</hi> into the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and ſhewed that the ſaid <hi>H.</hi> was ſeiſed of the ſaid Land, called <hi>Drayners,</hi> in his Demeſne as of Fee, and thereof enfeoffed certain perſons unto the uſe of himſelf, and the ſaid <hi>Anne Capel,</hi> for the term of their lives, and afterwards, by his Indenture, dated the 23. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> and enrolled, bargained and ſold the Reverſion thereof to the ſaid <hi>Gray, &amp;c.</hi> by force whereof, <hi>&amp;c. Abſque hoc,</hi> that he was ſeiſed in tail, and <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that he thereof died ſeiſed in his Demeſne, as of Fee-tail, as it is found by the ſaid Office: and for the Land in <hi>Barmeſden,</hi> he ſaid, that the Lady <hi>Judde</hi> was ſeiſed thereof for the term of her life, the Reverſion to the ſaid <hi>H.</hi> in Fee, who granted to him the ſaid Reverſion in Fee, <hi>&amp;c. abſque hoc,</hi> that he died ſeiſed in his Demeſne as of Fee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And upon that, the Queen's Attorney joined iſſue, and the <hi>Venire facias</hi> iſſued, <hi>De Cottred &amp; Barmeſden;</hi> and the Iury found, That <hi>H.</hi> did not make the Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the uſe of himſelf and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife in tail; and farther found for <hi>Gray</hi> in all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was objected here, That the ſame is not a good and lawfull trial: For the Land is alledged to be in <hi>Codrett,</hi> and the <hi>Venire facias</hi> is of <hi>Codred, &amp;c.</hi> And although the <hi>Venire facias</hi> be well awarded, as unto <hi>Barmeſden,</hi> yet being naught in part, it is naught in all, which was granted by the whole Court; And then a new <hi>Venire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> ſhall iſſue forth for the whole. Another Objection was, becauſe he pleads that the Lady <hi>Judde</hi> was ſeiſed of that Land for the term of her life, in which Caſe <hi>Gray,</hi> who is in Reverſion, ought not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Traverſe, becauſe that Tenant for life, for any thing that is pleaded to the contrary, is yet alive; and it is clear, that none ſhall be put to his Traverſe, but the party grieved; and here he in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion upon an Eſtate for life, cannot be reſtored to the poſſeſſion, and by conſequence ſhall not have Traverſe: See for that, 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. and 37. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The ſeiſin in tail ought to be traverſed, and not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, or dying ſeiſed; for if they were ſeiſed and diſſeiſed, and ſo died, the Queen ſhall have the Ward. <hi>Coke,</hi> contrary, For <hi>Codred</hi> and <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, idem ſonant, &amp;c.</hi> And although that it be found by Office, that <hi>H.</hi> was ſeiſed of Lands in <hi>Codred, alias Codreth,</hi> yet the Defendant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the ſaid matter; for he ſaith thus as unto the Land in <hi>Codred prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta;</hi> which words import that the ſaid Land was known by the one name or the other; for this word <hi>praedicta,</hi> is as an Averment: which ſee 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br.

The Statute of 18 <hi>H.</hi> 6. gives Traverſe to thoſe who find themſelves grieved by ſuch Offices, or which are put out of their Lands or Tenements; and we are within the words of it, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, we are out of poſſeſſion, as it was ruled in the Caſe of one <hi>Stukely</hi> in the Court of <hi>Wards</hi> the laſt Term. If it be found by Office, That <hi>A.</hi> died ſeiſed of my Manor, and that he held the ſaid Manor of the Queen: Now I am out of poſſeſſion; and for that cauſe, the bargain and ſale of <hi>Dorrel</hi> to Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> was holden void by the whole Court: And 4 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 12.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61358:101"/>
Exception, The Letters Patents here ſhewed in diſcharge, are of no value; for the King by his Letters Patents cannot diſinherit any one, <hi>Erg.</hi> nor diſcharge one of Toll wich is a kind of diſinheritance; To which it was ſaid, That the Plaintiff doth not declare of any Grant, but of an uſage or cuſtome, for thoſe of ancient Demeſn; and farther, hath commanded by the ſaid Letters Patents, that ſuch cuſtoms and uſages ſhould hold place; and upon the cuſtome, and the contempt, this Action is grounded: A fifth exception, becauſe the Plaintiff hath not ſhewed, that the Toll whereof the Plaintiff hath counted, was concerning things for proviſion for their houſes, manurance of their lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 111. In an Action upon the Caſe for not paying of Toll, The Defendant ſaid, That he held certain lands of <hi>R.</hi> Lord of the Manor of <hi>H.</hi> which Manor is ancient Demeſn, of which Manor all the Tenants have been free, to ſell or buy beaſts or other things, for the manurance of their lands, and maintenance of their houſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying Toll in any Market or Fair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo juſtifies, that he came to the ſame Market, and bought certain beaſts, as the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff had declared, and that ſome of them he uſed about his manurance of his lands, and ſome of them he put into paſture to make them fat, and more fit to be ſold, and afterwards, he ſold them at ſuch a Fair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the opinion of the Court was with the Defendant: And by <hi>Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Coke,</hi> Such Tenants ſhall be diſcharged of Toll, not onely for buying of things which concern their ſuſtenance, proviſion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurance of their lands, but alſo for all things bought, as common mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes: 28 <hi>Aſſ. ult.</hi> by <hi>Thorp, Green</hi> and <hi>Seton,</hi> of all things bought by any for his own uſe, they ſhall be quit of Toll: and then, If the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Tenants in ancient Demeſn, ſhall not be quit of Toll, but for things bought for their ſuſtenance, proviſion and manurance of their lands, they have no more favor than ordinary Subjects: See 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6.66. Some are of opinion, That ſuch Tenants ſhall not pay Toll for things ſold and bought, coming upon their lands, and touching their ſuſtenance: See <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 228. <hi>D.</hi> ſuch Tenants are diſcharged of Toll for all things by them ſold and bought, by way of merchandize; as alſo of things of neceſſity, as ſuſtenance: And ſee <hi>Crook,</hi> in the caſes of <hi>Itiner.</hi> 138. he conceives, that ſuch Tenants for merchandizes ſhall pay Toll as other merchants; but ſee the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 228. the words are <hi>De bonis, &amp; rebus ſuis,</hi> And <hi>Coke</hi> ſaid, That he had found the reaſon wherefore ſuch Tenants ſhould be quit of Toll throughout the Realm, in an ancient Reading, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the lands in the hands of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> and <hi>Wil.</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> ſet down in the Book of <hi>Doomſday</hi> were ancient Demeſn, and ſo called <hi>Terrae Regis,</hi> and they were to provide victuals for the Kings Garriſons, for then they were troublſome times; and for thoſe cauſes, and becauſe they made proviſions for others, they had many privileges, amongſt which this one; <hi>Ut quietius aratra ſua exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerent, &amp; terram excolerent:</hi> The Lord himſelf, in ancient Demeſn ſhall not have ſuch privilege, for his Seignory is pleadable at the Common Law: <hi>Vid. F. N. B.</hi> 228. <hi>B.</hi> And he ſaid, That the Plaintiff ought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that his lands are parcel of ſuch a Manor; for there cannot be ancient Demeſn, if there be not a Court and Suitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſuch a Town might be ancient Demeſn of the Crown, but yet they ſhall not have the privileges and liberties which the Tenants in ancient Demeſn have. Towns were before Manors: <hi>London</hi> hath the name of ancient Demeſn, and yet they have not ſuch liberties, nor the lands in it pleadable by <hi>Writ</hi> of right Cloſe. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31, 32. <hi>Shute,</hi> Iuſtice, was of opinion, That an Inhabitant within ancient Demeſn, although he be not Tenant ſhall have the privileges: See for that, <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 228. <hi>B.</hi> Tenants at will in ancient Demeſn ſhall be diſcharged of Toll, as well as Tenants of the Freehold for life, or for years, 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 27. by <hi>Moile. London</hi> is ancient Demeſn; for they preſcribe, that a Villein who hath
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61358:102"/>
there dwelt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall not be taken from thence by <hi>Capias,</hi> or <hi>Attachment, Billing. London</hi> is not in the Book of <hi>Doomſday. Moile,</hi> They make their Proteſtation in a <hi>Writ</hi> of Right Patent. <hi>Littleton,</hi> That is uſed in divers places, and at this day in <hi>Exeter.</hi> And by <hi>Clench,</hi> If a Tenant in ancient Demeſn levyeth a Fine of his lands, then he ſhall not have the privilege, untill the Fine be reverſed, <hi>Quod fuit conceſſum:</hi> If the Lord of a Manor in ancient Demeſn, purchaſeth all the Tenancies, the whole privilege is gone, which <hi>Coke</hi> denyed.

But the whole Court was of a contrary opinion; for it is in the election of the Leſſee to take the Conveyance as a Feoffment, or as a confirmation: And here it appeareth upon the Deed, that the intent of both parties was, That the Leſſee ſhould take by way of Feoffment, and not of confirmation; for otherwiſe, to what uſe ſhould be a Letter of Attorney inſerted in the Deed? And here the Leſſee hath liberty to make his election how he will take; either by Feoffment, or by confirmation, which election he hath determined by the acceptance of the Livery: And by <hi>Anderſon,</hi> If tenant in tail be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed, and makes a Charter of Feoffment, and delivers the ſame to the Diſſeiſor, who delivers the ſame to the Attorney, named in the Charter, who makes Livery accordingly: here is a good Feoffment, and a diſcontinuance; and afterwards, after many motions made, and day given to ſhew cauſe, Iudgment was given, that the Plaintiff ſhould be barred.</p>

Where if a Iury be charged with ſeveral iſſues, and the one of the iſſues is found, and the other not; that the ſame makes no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance: or if one of the iſſues be diſcontinued, yet it is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance as to the whole.

But <hi>Coke</hi> found out another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a thing put in iſſue which is not in the Verdict, nor found, nor touched in the Verdict, and that was the Verdict of all which is found not to be good, and it is not helped by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of <hi>Jeofailes.</hi> I grant, that diſcontinuances are helped by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but imperfect Verdicts are not helped thereby:<note place="margin">Vid. 205.</note> It was a great Caſe argued in the <hi>Exchequer Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and it was <hi>Brache</hi>'s Caſe: An information was againſt <hi>Brache,</hi> for entring into a houſe, and an hundred Acres of Lands in <hi>Stepney;</hi> He pleaded, not guilty, The Iury found him guilty for the hundred acres, but ſaid nothing as to the houſe; upon which a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> was brought, and Iudgment was reverſed: and he ſaid, it was not a diſcontinuance, but no verdict for part. <hi>Daniel,</hi> That was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of the Clerks who did not enter it, and it hath been the uſage to amend the defaults done by the Clerks in another Term: All the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices ſaid, That is true, if the <hi>Poſtea</hi> be brought in and not entred; but here it is entred in the Roll in this form. <hi>Daniel,</hi> Where I charge one in Accompt with ſo much by the hands of ſuch a one, and ſo much by the hands of ſuch a one, although there be but one <hi>Abſque hoc</hi> to them all, yet they are as ſeveral iſſues.

                     <hi>DIghton</hi> brought Debt upon a Bond, the Condition of which was, That whereas the Plaintiff was in quiet poſſeſſion of ſuch lands, If now neither <hi>J. S.</hi> nor <hi>J. B.</hi> nor <hi>J. G.</hi> did not diſturb the Plaintiff in his poſſeſſion of the ſaid lands by any indirect means, but by due courſe of Law, That then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Defendant pleaded, That neither <hi>J. S.</hi> nor <hi>J. D.</hi> or <hi>J. G.</hi> did diſturb the Plaintiff by any indirect means, but by due courſe of Law; upon which there was a demurrer. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> The Plea in Bar is not good; for there is a <hi>Negativa pregnans, (ſcil.)</hi> a Negative which implies an Affirmative: See 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6.9. In a <hi>Writ of Entry, Sur Diſſeiſin,</hi> the Defendant ſaith, That the Demandant by his Deed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Darrein</hi> continuance, did confirm and ratifie the poſſeſſion of the Tenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Demandant ſaid, Not his Deed after the <hi>Darrein</hi> continuance; and the ſame was holden to be, <hi>Negativa pregnans;</hi> See more there, and ſee alſo 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 7. And ſee farther, 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 8, 9. Another Exception was taken to the Plea in Bar, becauſe he hath pleaded, That <hi>neque J. S. neque J. D. neque J. G.</hi> had diſturbed the Demandant by any indirect means, but onely by due courſe of Law; and that iſſue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be tried; not by the Countrey, for they cannot know what is a due courſe of Law; and by the Court it cannot be tried, for the Defendant hath not certainly ſhewed by what due courſe of Law the Demandant hath been diſturbed, which ſee 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 40, 41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord <hi>Liſle</hi>'s Caſe. In Debt upon a Bond, the Condition was, That if the Defendant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a day, or any other for him, and in his name, come to <hi>B.</hi> and there ſhew unto the Plaintiff, or one of his Council, by him aſſigned, a ſufficient and lawfull diſcharge of an annual Rent which the Plaintiff claims out of two houſes of the Defendant in <hi>B.</hi> aforeſaid, That then the ſaid Bond ſhall be void; and the Defendant ſaid, That he at the day aſſigned, contained in the Condition, that <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> by aſſignment of the Defendant came to <hi>B.</hi> and tendred to ſhew to <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> of the Plaintiff's Council, a ſufficient diſcharge of the ſaid annual Rent, and that they did refuſe to ſee it, upon which there was a demurrer in Law: and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, and that the Plea was no Plea; for the Defendant ought to have ſhewed in his Plea, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſcharge he would have ſhewed, as a releaſe, unity of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as the Caſe is here; If the Plaintiff ſhall traverſe the Plea in Bar, the iſſue joined upon it cannot be tried, for the Iury can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know which is a lawfull and ſufficient diſcharge, but the ſame ſhall be tried by the Court; for if the Defendant had tendered to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff a diſcharge by unity of poſſeſſion, the Iury cannot know if it be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſcharge: and as the Plea is here, he hath not ſhewed what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61358:105"/>
he would have ſhewed to the ſaid Council; and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of the ſame: If one be bound to plead a ſufficient Plea before ſuch a day, in ſuch a Court, in ſuch an Action, it is not ſufficient that he hath pleaded a ſufficient Plea, but he ought to ſhew what Plea he hath pleaded, otherwiſe the Court cannot judge if the Plea be ſufficient or not: <hi>Vid.</hi> 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 19. and 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br. Cand.</hi> 16. where a man will plead that he hath ſaved the party harmleſs, he ought to ſhew how. <hi>Shute,</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and <hi>Clench,</hi> Iuſtice, If the Defendant had pleaded, not diſturbed by any indirect means, ſuch a Plea had been good enough: <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, If he had pleaded, not diſturbed <hi>contra formam Conditionis praed.</hi> it had been a good Plea; In a <hi>Writ of Entry, Ne entra pas, contra formam Statuti,</hi> He did not alien within age, is a <hi>Negative pregnant:</hi> but the party may ſay, he did not alien, <hi>Modo &amp; forma;</hi> all the part to this Plea which comes after the <hi>But,</hi> is ſurpluſage, and Negation: <hi>Gawdy,</hi> It is a Plea which is pleaded with all the words of the Condition intirely. <hi>Clench,</hi> The Caſe put by <hi>Godfrey,</hi> 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. differs from the Caſe at Bar: For there he pleaded all in the affirmative, therefore in ſuch a Caſe he ought to plead ſpecially; but in the Caſe at Bar all is in the Negative, in which Caſe ſuch ſpecial pleading is not neceſſary. If I be bounden that I ſhall not go out of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> untill night, but tarry in the <hi>Hall</hi> till night, In an Action againſt me upon that Bond, I may plead <hi>in iiſdem verbis:</hi> If I be bound upon Condition, That I will not return to <hi>Serjeant's-Inn</hi> the direct way, but by St. <hi>Giles,</hi> I ſhall plead, <hi>in totidem verbis: Godfrey,</hi> I agree thoſe Caſes, for the matter which comes after the <hi>But,</hi> is triable by the Countrey, but ſo it is not in the principal Caſe: <hi>Clench, But</hi> is but a word of ſurpluſage, and if that, and all which follows had been left out, it had been well enough.

Godb. 123.</note> and killing of eighteen Conies there; the Defendant, as to all the Treſpaſs, but to the killing of the Conies, pleaded, Not guilty: and as to the killing of the ſaid Conies, He ſaid that the place Where, is a Heath, in which he hath common of paſture, and that he found the Conies eating the graſs there, and he killed them, and carried them away, as it was lawfull for him to do: <hi>Cowper,</hi> Although Conies be, <hi>Ferae naturae,</hi> yet when they are in in-grounds, they are reduced to ſuch a property, that if they be killed or carried away, I ſhall have an Action of treſpaſs, <hi>Vid.</hi> 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 24. And if a Deer be hunted by the Plaintiff in a Foreſt, and afterwards in hunting it be driven out of the Foreſt, and the Forreſter doth follow the chaſe, and the Plaintiff kill the Deer in his own grounds, yet the Forreſter may enter into the land of the Plaintiff, and re-take the Deer, 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 9. And although the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant hath common in the ſoil; yet he cannot meddle with the wood there, nor with the land, nor with the graſs, otherwiſe than with the feeding of his cattel, for he hath but a faint intereſt; And if he who hath the Freehold in the land, bringeth an Action of treſpaſs againſt ſuch a commoner for entring into his land, and the Defendant plead, Not guilty, he cannot give in evidence that he hath common there: And it hath been late adjudged, That where commoners preſcribe,<note place="margin">Godb. 123.</note> That the Lord hath uſed to put in ſuch a paſture but ſo many beaſts, that ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is a void preſcription: It was argued on the other ſide, That the owner of the ſoil, hath not the true property of the Conies in him, but a kind of property: And ſee <hi>F.N.

At another day, the Caſe was moved again; and then it was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by <hi>Coke,</hi> and he ſaid, The point is; Whether a commoner having common of paſture, may kill the Conies which are upon the ground; and he argued, That he might not. And firſt, he ſaid, It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what intereſt he who hath the Freehold may have in ſuch things as are, <hi>Ferae naturae;</hi> and then what authority a commoner hath in the ground in which he hath common. As to the firſt point, he ſaid, That although ſuch beaſts are, <hi>Ferae naturae,</hi> yet they are reduced to ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty when they are in my ground by reaſon of my poſſeſſion which I then have of them, that I may have an Action of treſpaſs againſt him who taketh them away: as in the book in, 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. If one hath Deer in his Park, and another taketh them away, he may have an Action of Treſpaſs for the taking of them: See 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8. If a Keeper or Forreſter follow a Buck which is chaſe out of the Park or Forreſt, although he who hunteth him killeth the Buck in his own ground, yet the Keeper or Forreſter may enter into his ground, and ſeize the Deer, becauſe the property and poſſeſſion of the Deer is yet in them by their perſuit: In 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. It is holden, That if a wild beaſt doth go out of the Park, the owner of the ſoil hath loſt his property in it; but upon the ſaid book, it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61358:107"/>
may be well collected, that whileſt it remains in the Parke, That the owner of the Park hath property in it; for 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14.

B.</hi> If a <hi>Writ</hi> of Treſpaſs be brought, <hi>Quare Cuniculas ſuas cepit,</hi> the <hi>Writ</hi> ſhall abate; and yet he hath a kind of property, or a poſſeſſion rather in them. I grant that againſt a ſtranger the Plaintiff might have his Action for killing of his Conies, but not againſt the commoner, becauſe the commoner hath a wrong done unto him by the Conies, eating of his common, and therefore he may kill them; and although the commoner may not meddle with the land, becauſe he hath not an intereſt in it; yet in ſome caſes he may meddle with the profits of it, and he may diſtrain the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of a ſtranger there, damage-feaſance; as the Book is in 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. I grant that it is not lawfull for Tenant for life to kill the Conies of him who hath free-warren in the land. For if a man bringeth an Action of Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare warrenam ſuam intravit, &amp; Cuniculos ſuos cepit:</hi> It is no Plea for the Defendant to ſay, That it is his Freehold. See 43. <hi>E.</hi> 3. accordingly. In <hi>L.</hi> 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. In Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare clauſum fregit, &amp; Cuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos ſuos cepit:</hi> The Defendant ſaid, That the Plaintiff made a Leaſe at will to <hi>J.

If I have common of paſture in lands, and the Tenant ploweth up the land, I ſhall have an action upon the Caſe in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Quod permittat.</hi> And in 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. If one hath lands adjoyning to my land, and levyeth a Nuſance, I may enter upon the land, and abate the Nuſance: So if a man taketh my goods and carrieth them unto his own lands, I may enter therein, and ſeize my goods: So if a Tenant of the Freehold plows the land and ſoweth it with corn, the commoner may put in his cattel, and therewith eat the corn grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the land: So if a man do falſly impriſon me, and put me in his houſe, I may juſtifie the breaking open of his houſe to get forth.

is laid to be, <hi>apud London, in Warda de Farrington extra,</hi> and ſo <hi>apud London;</hi> and <hi>extra London,</hi> which is repugnant: 6.

The third Error is miſtaken: The fourth is answered as the two firſt; for it is but matter of recital; and the conſideration paſt and executed before the <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> and not at the time of the <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> and but an Induction or conveyance to the Promiſe: The fifth matter is miſ-conſtrued; for there are two Wards of <hi>Farrington, infra, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra: infra</hi> the Walls, and <hi>extra</hi> the Walls, and yet both, <hi>apud Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and <hi>extra</hi> is to be referred to <hi>Farrington,</hi> and not to <hi>London;</hi> and there ought to be made a point after <hi>extra;</hi> as <hi>Farrington extra; Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The ſixth is miſtaken; for there is no Error in that: for the Aſſignee is poſſeſſed, <hi>Virtute dimiſſionis;</hi> for the original Leaſe is the virtue and ſtrength of the poſſeſſion of the Aſſignee: But if theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions had been material, yet foraſmuch as the iſſue is not upon the <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> for that is confeſſed by the Defendant, and by that the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, conſideration, and all the ſpecial matters confeſſed to be true: But the Defendant hath pleaded a new matter after the <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> in diſcharge of the <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> which diſcharge is found againſt him, all the particulars in which the Errors are aſſigned, are out of the Book; and now the matter of diſcharge is onely material: As in debt for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of Rent reſerved on a Leaſe for years, if the time and place of the making of the Leaſe be not ſet forth in the Declaration, the Declaration is not good. But if the Defendant plead a collateral matter; as releaſe of the arrearages, or other ſuch matter, now all the imperfections of the Declaration are waved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At another day the matter was argued again. There are three manner of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon which an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> may be grounded: 1 A debt precedent: 2 Where he to whom ſuch a promiſe is made, is damnified by doing any thing, or ſpends his labour at the inſtance of the Promiſer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no benefit cometh to the Promiſer: As I agree with a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to cure a poor man (who is a ſtranger unto me) of a ſore, who doth it accordingly, he ſhall have an Action: 3 Or there is a preſent conſideration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The firſt Exception was, becauſe the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> being laid to procure ſuch a Leaſe which another had, <hi>i. e.</hi> one <hi>A.</hi> it is not ſhewed in the Declaration, <hi>in facto,</hi> That <hi>A.</hi> had ſuch a Leaſe, and if he had not any ſuch Leaſe, then there cannot be any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to procure it: For, <hi>Ex nihilo, nihil fit.</hi> Secondly, the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61358:108"/>
is, That <hi>A.</hi> was poſſeſſed of a Leaſe for years, to be ended and determined in <hi>An.</hi> 1606. without ſhewing any beginning of it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Leaſe be but matter of Conveyance and inducement, yet, becauſe it is the ground of the Action, it ought to be certainly and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſet forth. Thirdly, the Leaſe to be procured, is laid to be made by a <hi>College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and it is not ſhewed for what term of years, <hi>i. e.</hi> for 21 years or under; for if it be above, then ſuch Leaſe is void. Fourthly, It is not laid in the Declaration, that the Leaſe was by writing, and then void; for a <hi>College</hi> cannot make a Leaſe without writing; and it ſhall be intended it was made without Deed, becauſe it is not laid to be by Deed: As if a <hi>Corporation</hi> makes a Leaſe for life, and afterwards granteth the Reverſion for years, he that will entitle himſelf to the ſaid Reverſion, ought to ſay in pleading That he made the Leaſe for life by Deed, although the Leaſe for life in ſuch caſe be but matter of Conveyance: Fifthly, It is not laid in the Declaration, That the Leaſe to be aſſured was in <hi>eſſe,</hi> and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance at the time it was to be aſſured; for although it be laid to be in <hi>eſſe,</hi> at the time of the promiſe, yet being a particular intereſt, it ſhall not be intended to continue, if it be not ſpecially ſhewed: As 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 26. Sixthly, Here the Plaintiff hath not cauſe of Action, but <hi>Palmer,</hi> for the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> upon which the Action is grounded, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is to be payable to <hi>Palmer,</hi> not to the Plaintiff, 2 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 5. My Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff lets my Land to Farm, rendring Rent, he ſhall not have an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Rent, but I my ſelf, in whoſe right he leaſed: 25 <hi>Eliz.</hi> It was the Caſe of one <hi>Crewe,</hi> I promiſed unto <hi>J. S.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">25 Eliz. Crew's Caſe.</note> That in conſideration that he will make unto me a Leaſe for years of ſuch Lands, I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the ſame to his ſervant. If he will not make the Leaſe, not <hi>J.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61358:109"/>
Inrollment of the Deed of Aſſignment, the 18. of <hi>May.</hi> So it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth upon the Record, That the intruſion is ſuppoſed to be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queen have any intereſt in the Lands, in which the intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſuppoſed, for nothing was in the Queen before the Inrollment; For the Queen is a Corporation of State, of ſuch prerogative and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that ſhe cannot give or take intereſt in any Lands without matter of Record; and this Leaſe is a Chattel Real, and intereſt in Lands: See as to the Inrollment, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30, 31. 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 7. 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 16. But I grant that if the Leſſee for years be outlawed, the Leaſe ſhall be in the King, without Office, for the <hi>Outlawry</hi> it ſelf is a ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to entitle the King to it: If the Queen makes a Leaſe for years of Land, rendring Rent, with clauſe, That if the Rent be behind, that the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe if the Rent be not paid, it was agreed here in Sir <hi>Moile Finche</hi>'s Caſe,<note place="margin">Sir Moile Finches Caſe.</note> That the Leſſee continuing his poſſeſſion, ſhall not be accounted an intruder before Office thereof found; but he ſhall be accountant to the Queen for the profits, as Bailiff of his own wrong. But here we are charged with intruſion: It hath been doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if perſonal things be in the King without Office, 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. but now it is clear that it is: as 35 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Br.

And here it appeareth upon Record, that this Deed of Aſſignment, was delivered to Baron <hi>Clark,</hi> the 16 of <hi>May,</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> and to that we ſay, That the ſaid day was, <hi>Dies Aſcentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, &amp; ſic non juridicus,</hi> and ſo no Court there then holden, and then the ſaid Deed was not delivered in Court of Record, and then not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him as a Iudge, but as a private perſon, although it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the uſe of the Queen: But in 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. there is ſome opinion, That if ſuch a Deed be delivered in Court to one of the Barons, or be put into the King's Coffers, that then it is a Record. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, And as to the firſt Exception; It is to be known, That in every Plea, where a contempt is laid to the charge of the Defendant; he ought firſt to excuſe or clear the contempt: and therefore here, the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium</hi> of the Plea is, <hi>Quoad venire vi &amp; armis, &amp; quicquid eſt in contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum dominae Reginae, nec non de tota ulteriore tranſgreſſione &amp; contemptu per ipſos fieri ſuppoſit. ipſe in nullo eſt inde culpabilis:</hi> and afterwards plead o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and ſo it is in an Action of treſpaſs: and alſo upon the Statute of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. of Forcible entry; and here the iſſue upon the contempt follows the other iſſue: for if the one iſſue be found againſt the Defendant, ſo alſo is the other. As to the other point, I grant, That a Corporation cannot take, or ſpeak without writing: And the King being the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of Corporations, and the chief of Corporations, and who makes all Corporations, cannot take without a writing of as high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Record.

Egerton,</hi> Solicitor General, The Record doth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Iudgment given upon it; for poſſeſſion laid in the <hi>Queen</hi> is ſufficient to maintain this information; and here <hi>Payne</hi> doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the title of the <hi>Queen,</hi> but traverſeth the intruſion, and therefore being found an intruder by Verdict, Iudgment ought to be given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, for the Iury have found the intruſion generally, and not ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the 17 of <hi>May,</hi> and that cannot be aſſigned for Error, for it is part of the Verdict of which Error doth not lye, but attaint, for if any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was, the ſame was in the Iury and not in the Court; which <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> granted: <hi>Tanfield,</hi> As unto the Caſe of continuance of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, it is clear, that every continuance ought to have a beginning; for a thing which hath not a beginning, cannot be continued; and here is not any beginning; for the beginning which is laid in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is pretended to be, 17 <hi>Maii,</hi> and that cannot be for the Cauſe aforeſaid: <hi>Popham,</hi> If an information be brought of intruſion, as appears in many <hi>Memorandums</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> where, in truth, there is not any Record to prove it, and the Iury find the intruſion: Will you have a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> upon it?

                  <p>
                     <hi>JOhn Beale</hi> was Plaintiff in a <hi>Replevin,</hi> againſt <hi>Robert Langley</hi> and <hi>Roger Hill:</hi> The Caſe was, That <hi>Henry,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Manor of <hi>Bury</hi> in his Demeſn as of Fee, whereof the place in which, was parcel demiſed and demiſeable, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the ſaid Manor by Copy in Fee, whereof <hi>Langley</hi> was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piholder in Fee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſaid Earl ſo ſeiſed, enfeoffed divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſaid Manor unto the uſe of himſelf for life, and afterwards to the uſe of the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife, daughter of the ſaid Earl, and the heirs of their two bodies begotten, who made a Leaſe of the ſaid Cuſtomary lands by Indenture unto the Plaintiff for 100 years; and the queſtion was, If by this Leaſe, the lands be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Manor, that the Copihold is extinct: <hi>Walmeſly</hi> took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the pleading; for that <hi>Langley</hi> pleads, That the cuſtome within the Manor is, That if any Copiholder ſeiſed of Cuſtomary lands of the ſaid Manor dieth thereof ſeiſed, having many ſons, That the youngeſt ſon ſhall inherit; and he ſheweth, That the Lord of the ſaid Manor granted to his father and his mother the ſaid cuſtomary lands, by Copy, to have to his ſaid father and mother, and the heirs of his father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that his father died, and that his mother ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived him and died, and he as youngeſt ſon, according to the cuſtome entred, and he ſaid, That this cuſtome, ſet forth by the Defendant, doth not maintain his entry; For the cuſtome intendeth but a general and immediate deſcent upon a Copy made unto a man, and to his heirs, but ſuch is not the deſcent here, for the wife ſurviveth; during whoſe life, the heir cannot enter; nor is there here ſuch Eſtate in the father of the Defendant unto whom the cuſtome ſet forth in the Avowry can extend: For the cuſtome is alledged, Where a Copyholder hath a Copyhold Eſtate to him and his heirs. And here the Title of the Defendant is, That a cuſtomary Eſtate was granted to the father and the mother, and the heirs of the father, ſo as this Eſtate is not within the Letter of the cuſtome; And to that purpoſe he cited the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Savage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir John Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage's <hi>Caſe.</hi> ante 109.</note> late adjudged, Where one entitled himſelf to a Copihold in this manner; That within the Manor, there is ſuch a cuſtome, that if one taketh to wife any cuſtomary Tenant of the ſaid Manor in Fee, and hath iſſue by her, he, if he over-live ſuch wife, ſhould be Tenant by the Curteſie, and the Caſe in truth was. That he married a woman, who at the time of the marriage, had not any Copihold, but afterwards, during the coverture, a Copihold deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to her. In that Caſe, it was holden, That no Tenancy by the Curteſie did accrue by that cuſtome, which did not extend, but where the wife is a Copiholder at the marriage; and a cuſtome ſhall be in conſtruction taken ſtrictly, and ſhall not be extended beyond the words of it. And as to the matter in Law, he ſaid, That by this Leaſe, the cuſtome was gone, and then by conſequence, the cuſtomary Tenancy, as to that land is determined; for the Eſtate of the Copiholder is, <hi>Secundum conſuetudinem Manerii, ad voluntatem Dom.</hi> And now by the Leaſe, <hi>Langley</hi> cannot hold, <hi>Secundum conſuetudinem Manerii;</hi> for now the ſervices reſerved upon the Copy, and the advantages of Waſte, and other forfeitures, are extinct; ſo that if notwithſtanding the Leaſe, the cuſtomary intereſt ſhould endure, then ſuch a Copiholder ſhould hold this land, diſcharged of all ſervices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in better Eſtate than any Freeholder at the Common Law, and becauſe the ſervices in Law are diſcharge, and cannot be recovered, for that cauſe the cuſtomary intereſt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61358:110"/>
is determined: For the Caſe is, 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 19. by <hi>Danby,</hi> That the Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder ſhall have remedy againſt his Lord, if he put him out, for he payes a Fine when he enters; but here, during this Leaſe, no Fine can be paid upon any deſcent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Fine is the cauſe, for which the Copiholder ſhall maintain his poſſeſſion againſt the Lord: But here no deſcent or ſurrender can be preſented; for there is not any Tenant who can do it: See 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 80. by <hi>Brian,</hi> As long as the Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder payeth unto the Lord the cuſtoms and ſervices, If the Lord put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him out, he ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs: 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 25. If the Copiholder will not do his ſervices, the Lord ſhall ſeize the lands:<note place="margin">Dyer 100. 1 Cro. 35.</note> And he reſembled this Caſe, to the caſe where the King grants lands, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis hominibus de D.</hi> the ſame is a good Grant, and that onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Rent, and for the reaſon of that, it is a good Corporation: But if the King releaſeth the Rent, the Corporation is diſſolved, and the Grant is become void: <hi>Fenner,</hi> Serjeant, contrary; and he ſaid, That by this Leaſe, being the act of the Lord himſelf, the cuſtomary intereſt is not determined, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the whole Court was of clear opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>Fenner,</hi> That the Copihold did remain, for otherwiſe, by ſuch practices of the Lords, all the Copiholders in <hi>England</hi> might be defeated; and if any prejudice be grown to the Lord by this act, it is of his own doing, and againſt his own act he ſhall not be relieved: And by <hi>Periam,</hi> Iuſtice, The Lord by his act, <hi>i. e.</hi> the making of the Leaſe, hath deſtroyed his Seignory, and loſt the ſervices, as to this land: And <hi>Windham,</hi> Iuſtice ſaid, That the Lord himſelf had deſtroyed the cuſtome as to the ſervices, but not as to the cuſtomary intereſt of the Tenant; but the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> was of opinion, That the Rents and ſervices do remain; and if the Copiholder, after ſuch Leaſe committeth Waſte, that it is a forfeiture to the Lord; and that will fall in evidence upon a trial, although ſuch Waſte cannot be found by an ordinary preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the ſame Law which alloweth the Copiholder his Copihold intereſt againſt this Leaſe, will allow unto the Lord his Rents and ſervices: and he ſaid, That the Lord ſhall have the Rents and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not the Leſſee, <hi>Quod mirum,</hi> againſt his own Leaſe; See 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Murrel</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> now reported by the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his 4 <hi>Report. fol.</hi> 20.</p>

And the points moved upon it were argued by <hi>Atkins, Phetiplace, Fenner, Fleetwood, Plowden</hi> and <hi>Bromley,</hi> and afterwards this Caſe was argued by the Iuſtices: And <hi>Gawdy,</hi> puiſne Iuſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, That Iudgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff: Firſt, he conceived, that this Leaſe for years made by the Infant, without Deed and without Rent reſerved is not void; ſo as every ſtranger ſhall take advantage of it, but onely voidable; for an Infant may make a Bond, and a Contract for his commodity and profit, and the ſame ſhall bind him; as for his meat and drink, apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61358:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if upon ſuch Leaſe he had reſerved a ſmall Rent, as one peny, where the land was worth 100<hi>l. per ann.</hi> ſuch a Leaſe had been void; and in our Caſe, this Leaſe was made upon the land, and was made for to try the title to it, which is a good conſideration, and to the profit of the Infant, and for his advancement, and then the Leaſe is not void. It hath been objected, That here the Recovery being ſuffered to the intent that the Recoverers ſhould make an Eſtate, <hi>ut ſupra, &amp;c.</hi> that the uſe ſhall riſe preſently upon the Recovery to him who ſuffered the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and then the Recoverers could not make Livery unto him; he held ſtrongly, That the uſe and the poſſeſſion ſhould be adjudged in the Recoverers, untill they made the Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe could not make the Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Roll 789.</note> and theſe words <hi>[To the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent]</hi> ſhallbe conſtrued, that they ſhall have the lands, untill they made the Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he held, that the remainder limited, <hi>Seniori puero,</hi> where there is not any, <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> is good enough: as a remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der limited to him who ſhall firſt come to <hi>Pauls.</hi> And he conceived, that the ſon ſhould take this remainder, and not the daughter: and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Eſtate tail here, was not executed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſecond intail; Divers Authors of <hi>Grammer,</hi> have been produced to prove, that <hi>Puer,</hi> may be taken both ways, <hi>Tam puer, quam puella, Deſporterius, Calapine, Melancthon,</hi> and the <hi>Grammer</hi> allowed, but I conceive, that <hi>Puer</hi> is a word proper for a Boy, and <hi>Puella</hi> for a Maid; and where we have proper words, we ought not to iudge but according to them; and becauſe the word is doubtfull, we ought to conſider the cauſe upon the circumſtances, and therefore it is to be intended, that <hi>W. Humphreſton</hi> had a greater deſire that his ſon ſhould have his Inheritance, than his daughter, if there be not ſome ſpecial matter to prove that the intent of the father was for his daughter. <hi>Southcote,</hi> Iuſtice, agreed with <hi>Gawdy</hi> in the firſt point; and alſo that the Recoverers have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to make the Eſtates; and that they are to make the ſame without requeſt for the benefit of the wife, who is a ſtranger to it, and is to have the lands for her ioynture; and he cited the Caſe of the <hi>Abbat</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8. and 9. where the difference is taken between a Feoffment made upon condition to re-enfeoff the Feoffor, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoff a ſtranger: And here in our Caſe the Feoffment is made in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, and here is ſufficient conſideration, That the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſhall be ſeiſed to their own uſes, untill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe words,<note place="margin">Roll ſupra Roll 407.</note> 
                     <hi>[Ea intentione]</hi> ſhall be taken for a Condition: And alſo that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder limited, <hi>Seniori puero,</hi> is good notwithſtanding that there be not any <hi>Senior puer</hi> alive at the time. And as to the word <hi>(puer)</hi> he held, that it did extend to both Sexes indifferently; and becauſe it is doubtfull what Sex the father intended, we are to conſtrue the ſame upon the circumſtances, which appear upon the parts of the Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and here it appeareth upon the Indenture, that he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained his mind, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Eldeſt child, be it Male or Female: As if I have two ſons, named <hi>J.</hi> and I deviſe my lands, or limit a remainder to <hi>J.</hi> my ſon, the Law ſhall conſtrue this Deviſe to extend to my youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſon; for without deviſe or limitation my eldeſt ſon ſhould have it. But if <hi>J. S.</hi> hath two ſons, known by the names of <hi>A.</hi> and I Deviſe lands to <hi>A.</hi> ſon of <hi>J.S.</hi> there I ought to explain my meaning openly: And he conceived, That the Eſtate tail is executed defeaſiable in <hi>W. Humphreſton,</hi> upon iſſue afterwards had; and that the daughter ſhould have the lands, and not the ſon; and if the Fine deſtroy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in abeyance limited to the eldeſt child, then the ſaid eldeſt child ſhall have it, <hi>de novo,</hi> by the later conveyance. And as to the Warranty of the Fine, becauſe the poſſeſſion of the Conuſees is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to the daughter, ſhe ſhall not have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Warranty as to vouch, but ſhe ſhall Rebutt: as 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 37. 69. Where a Feoffment in Fee is made to my Villein with Warranty
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61358:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and before that the Feoffor dieth, I enter upon my Villein, ſo as the Warranty upon the death of the Warrantor is not attached upon the poſſeſſion of my Villein, I ſhall not have advantage of that Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: A Diſſeiſor makes a Feoffment in Fee upon Condition, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſee re-leaſeth the Feoffee with Warranty, the Diſſeiſor entreth for the condition broken; now the Diſſeiſor ſhall Rebutt by that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, but not vouch. And here in our Caſe, the Fine is a diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, ſo as the ſon is put to his Action, if he had right, and then the Warranty ſhall bind him; but contrary, if his entry be lawfull. And as to the Leaſe made by the Infant, he conceived, that it being made without Rent, it was meerly void, for it was without conſideration. <hi>Wray,</hi> chief Iuſtice, As to the firſt point, he was of opinion, That the Recoverers ſhall be ſeiſed to their own uſe, untill they make the Eſtate for that was the uſe implied, for all uſes are directed and ruled by the intent implied or expreſſed of him, to whom the land is; and his intent was, that ſuch Eſtates ſhould be made, and to ſuch purpoſe the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was ſuffered: As if I enfeoff <hi>A.</hi> unto the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> for his life, there it is implied, That <hi>B.</hi> ſhall be ſeiſed of the Fee to my uſe, I cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, That <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall take the profits of my lands for his life, this is a good uſe of the lands for his life; and he held, that the Recoverors ſhould be ſeiſed to their own uſe, untill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Recoverers ought to make the Eſtates within convenient time, or otherwiſe the uſe ſhould be reveſted again in him who ſuffered the Recovery; and here the Eſtate was made within convenient time: And he ſaid, That in every Caſe where a remainder is limited in abeyance to one by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name, the ſame is not good, but by a general name it is good enough if the party be <hi>in eſſe</hi> when the remainder falls: as a remainder limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon an Eſtate for life unto the firſt ſon, or daughter of <hi>J. S.</hi> where <hi>J. S.</hi> at the time hath not any ſon or daughter, the ſame is good, if ſuch perſon ſhall be <hi>in eſſe,</hi> at the time of the death of the Tenant for life, 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. A remainder limited <hi>Filio primo genito, &amp;c.</hi> and 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz. Tail.</hi> 8. Land given to <hi>J. S. Et uxori quam primo matrimonio duxerit in uxorem,</hi> and afterwards he taketh a wife, ſhe ſhall take by the ſame Conveyance. And as to the Warranty, This Fine with Warranty was levyed to <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> unto the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder to the uſe of the eldeſt child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he intended, That the daughter ſhould not have the benefit of this Warranty; for by the Statute, the poſſeſſion is removed, and transferred in the <hi>Poſt</hi> before the Warranty could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach; and therefore the ſame ſhall not bind the ſon, neither by Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, nor by Rebutter: But Tenant by the Curteſie ſhall have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Warranty; for although he be in the <hi>Poſt,</hi> yet he continueth the Eſtate which was made to the wife. And as to the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we ought to conſider, that the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Vſes is, That <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhall have the lands in ſuch plight as he had the uſe, which was without Warranty; and therefore it ſhall be transferred into poſſeſſion without Warranty: As to the Leaſe made by the Infant without rent, profit, or other recompence, he conceived the ſame to be utterly void; as if he grant a Rent, or an Advowſon, he may ſay, that he did not grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the thing included in the Deed, doth not paſs, although he delivereth the Deed of Grant, with his own hand: Two ioynt-tenants within age, one makes a Leaſe of years, and dieth, the other ſhall avoid it; for the Leaſe is utterly void, of which every ſtranger may take advantage; but of acts voidable, it is otherwiſe: As two Infants joynt-tenants, the one Leaſeth for life, and makes Livery in perſon, and dieth, the other ſhall not avoid it: Two joynt-tenants, the one maketh a Feoffment upon condition, and dieth, the other ſhall not take benefit of the condition: But here the Leaſe is meerly void, of which every ſtranger ſhall take advantage, and therefore upon this point the Plaintiff ſhall be barred. And alſo he was of opinion, That
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61358:115"/>
this remainder in abeyance limited, <hi>Seniori puero,</hi> was not deſtroyed by the Fine, for it is in the conſideration of the Law, and ſo preſerved by the Law; and therefore a deſcent in the time of vacation of an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> ſhall not bind the ſucceſſor; and ſo where the party is beyond the ſeas; for ſuch perſons and their eſtates, the Law privilegeth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth: So a remainder limited to the right heirs of <hi>J. S.</hi> And where the King ſeiſeth by reaſon of a Ward, and during ſuch ſeiſin of the King, a deſcent is caſt, the ſame ſhall not bind him who hath right; for he could not enter upon the poſſeſſion of the King: and by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A Recovery had againſt Tenant for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the right heirs of <hi>J. S.</hi> who is alive at the time of the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is not helped by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute are, <hi>To whom the reverſion or remainder ſhall then appertain:</hi> See 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Fitz. Detin.</hi> 46. and ſo he concluded, becauſe that this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is in the cuſtody of the Law, and not in <hi>eſſe,</hi> it is privileged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and not deſtroyed by the Fine; and upon iſſue had, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall be executed, notwithſtanding the ſaid act done by the father; and without any entry to be made by the Conuſees to raiſe the uſe, for the remainder limited, <hi>Seniori puero,</hi> neither was, nor could be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: As to the principal point of the Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> How theſe words, <hi>Seniori puero,</hi> ſhall be expounded, although divers authorities have been cited out of Latine Authours, That this word <hi>(puer)</hi> ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Male or Female; yet I conceive, That more commonly, it ſhall be taken for the Male than for the Female, and we ought to judge according to the intent of the parties, and not according to the ſtrict ſignification of the word in Latine, eſpecially where it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full how it ſhall be expounded: 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>A.</hi> was bound in a Bond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition to pay, <hi>decem libras auri puri;</hi> although there be not any ſuch phraſe in Latine, yet becauſe it appeareth ſo to be the meaning of the Obligee to have fine gold, it was ſo taken: 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 10. and 11. The word <hi>(uterque) id eſt, quilibet pro parte ſua,</hi> See the Book: ſo it was lately adjudged in the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> where three were bounden, <hi>Et eorum uterque,</hi> which was conſtrued to be, <hi>Quilibet,</hi> for we ought always in conſtruction of Deeds, to have regard to the meaning of the parties, and not to argue the aptneſs of the Latine word. And I conceive, That if a Leaſe be made for life, the remainder <hi>puero</hi> of <hi>J. S.</hi> who hath a ſon and a daughter, the ſon ſhall have the land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the moſt worthy ſhall be preferred; and therefore, if a Freeman mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a Neife, ſhe is enfranchiſed for ever, according to the opinion of <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> which I hold to be good Law, for the husband is the more worthy: So if the Leaſe for life be made <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>J. S.</hi> the remainder to the right heirs of <hi>A. B.</hi> who hath iſſue three daughters, and dieth, the eldeſt ſhall have the remainder, and not the other with her, becauſe ſhe is the more worthy; and ſo a remainder upon an Eſtate for life of lands in <hi>Gavelkind</hi> limited to the right heirs of <hi>J. S.</hi> who hath iſſue two ſons, the eldeſt ſhall have it: So here in the principal Caſe, <hi>(Puer)</hi> ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſon, becauſe he is the more worthy: But here are other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which give occaſion of another conſtruction; for this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full word <hi>(Puer)</hi> is explained by the Engliſh Indenture, which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>W. Humphreſton,</hi> cauſed to be made; <hi>[Unto the uſe of the eldeſt Child]</hi> which is a good expoſition of the former Conveyance: and I am of opinion, that the ſame ought to be meant of the daughter, for ſo ſoon as ſhe is born, the remainder veſts in her, and by the birth of the ſon after ſhall not be deveſted: Land is leaſed to <hi>A.</hi> for life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to <hi>T.</hi> ſon of <hi>A.</hi> who hath two ſons of the ſame name, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſhall have it, becauſe the more worthy; but, if afterwards the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor declares his meaning to the contrary, the ſame ſhall ſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And afterwards Iudgment was given againſt the Plaintiff, and that the daughter ſhould have the Lands.</p>
